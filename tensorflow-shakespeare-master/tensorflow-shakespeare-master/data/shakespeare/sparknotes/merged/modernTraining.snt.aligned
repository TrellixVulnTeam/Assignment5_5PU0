Hello, sir!
Good morning, General.
And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry.
Death didn’t conquer 
For no man, sir.
Ate at home?
Better, since your lordship was nice enough to ask.
What do you mean?
Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw.
Read it.
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.
It’s only just now nine o'clock.
Give me some light!
I don’t want anything but that.
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord.
Well, sir, go inside.
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness.
I think so too.
Keep up your courage, man!
Stephano!
Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.
What did I keep for myself?
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
You couldn’t see him, but I could.
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!
Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you?
Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.
After you, sir.
Sorry, sir?
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on strict orders from him.
It’s time for us to stand guard.
I know you.
Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.
Goodbye.
No doubt, my lord.
Quiet, quiet!
Were his wounds on his front side?
Enliven them with yours!
I hope, sir, that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally attentive to you both!  
I’ll tell him the news.
Oh, that bird from hell!
You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
They were poisoned, then.
Kill Claudio.
No, that I don’t remember.
How are you, my royal lord?
Tell me, if your dark powers can see this far: will Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom?
Uncle, I’m coming out!
You’re defending an impostor?
What’s this, you dog?
My money’s almost run out.
My lady, will you have a dance with me?
For my brother Edward’s sake.
He’ll never follow anything that other men have started.
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.
Please, don’t speak to him.
Yes, sir.
Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little?
Oh, spite of spites!
How is my wife?
I humbly thank you, sir.
That’s me.
Here is the count of the slaughtered French.
It doesn’t get seen enough; you should wear it in your cap, the way fools wear coxcombs.
So, she’s in on this too!
By next week, I’ll be able to pay you.
I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick.
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before.
Come on. 
Good night, dear Captain Blunt.
Oh, my son, what issue is that?
I’ll ask you another question.
Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death.
Give a quick example.
Brother John Bates, isn’t that dawn breaking over there?
First, he said you had no right to him.
No, he didn’t get any by me.
Never contradict him.
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.
So he’s dead?
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.
See you soon.
We’ll be ready when the time comes.
What does Lord Stanley say?
But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
By Jesus, I am your Majesty’s countryman, and I don’t care who knows it.
But who is that?
Macbeth is ripe for the picking.
Catesby.
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.
I’m glad about that.
Everything except something to live on.
Who’s there!
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.
Who’s blocking the way?
My boy, it’s true.
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty.
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d never speak to them again.
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.
Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
To our horses, you gallant princes.
Hello to you too, sir.
I probably am too young for you.
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said.
No, please, speak seriously.
Stand away from the hearse.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
Bring them right in.
Our era should be ashamed!
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind.
Or just a foretaste of it?
That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind.
Ah, there’s the problem.
Take a few steps—I want to see you walk.
I’m sweating and trembling with fear.
I almost feel you.
You’re thought to be the most 
You know I gave it to you just now.
Instead of Celia, call me Aliena.
May God give their souls rest.
Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.
I believe it completely.
Bardolph, be happy.—Nym, rouse your bragging spirits.—Boy, be brave.
Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable.
A likely story!
Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.
Madam, I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval.
Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
Do you lie still?
If you won’t leave, then 
It’s all the same.
Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back.
Help, dear lord, or the battle will be lost!
So let me be brief here.
My lord, I informed them as much.
Good madam, let me speak.
He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here.
Are you trying to make fun of me?
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart.
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop!
Set him free.
Put the goblets of wine on that table.
Is that how it’s going to be?
Will you say grace, sweet Kate, or shall I?—What is this?
Kiss her soft mouth, and we’ll be off.
I wish I could believe you that all was well!
Are you dreaming or awake?
More of us are here.
Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.
And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty—penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter.
Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities.
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you’re afraid.
Let me go.
I’ll deliver the message.
The clock struck three.
Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you.
That’s true, sir.
Bad luck, bad luck?
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
Sir, you need a drink.
Are you talking, you villain?
That’s foolish.
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up, then I’ll lose my son twice.
Not now, my sweet Desdemona.
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
He’s an important person.
And I’ll help you.
I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio.
No, my good lord.
Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?
It was love that performed these miracles.
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Sir, sir!
Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue.
We’ll never see each other again.
What’s going on, daughter?
Here’s to you!
Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes.
Is it four o'clock?
Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there.
My father’s ghost—armed!
He called me Sebastian.
And what did Surrey say to that?
I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think.
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
What can I do for your highness?
If our secret’s known, either Caesar or I will die, for I’ll kill myself.
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
Good night, everyone.
He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail.
By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Let’s look in his pockets.
Let it be who it is.
Look, here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it.
And I get sick when I can’t look at you.
I’ve never been taught how to make anything.
Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy.
Who are these people?
Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword.
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings.
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Talk makes him crazy.
You have to be patient, madam.
And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.
Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest.
O, this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery.
Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.
Very good!
I wish I could see that man someday!
I’d like to get to know you better, Mr. Cobweb.
Only describing what you have ruined.
I sneeze on your manhood.
But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
Who’s in there?
And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.
She blushes at the slightest thing.
She’s a good little woman, and she adores me.
It’s about you.
I recognize the handwriting.
You’re mistaken about all that.
Whew!
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.
Speak plainly.
They were traitors.
I won’t hurt him.
He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do.
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.
Any trick that works is good for me.
What is your name, young man?
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.
Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy.
Damn it!
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.
Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly.
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.
Beatrice— I swear, I’m going.
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.
Damn you all!
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you.
Oh Clitus!    
And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.
I mean, what do the words say?
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad.
Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.
Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it).
In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me.
We’ll revenge his death.
With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic.
Don’t you hear me speaking?
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena.
You’re most welcome.
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes.
Come, sweet nymphs, and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers.
Here he comes with Captain Jamy, the Scots captain.
The “passionate” duke?
Nothing, my lord.
Do you know me?
He stole it from me.
It’s you we were laughing at.
He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.
My worthy Cawdor!
Where’s the Master?
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
He’s my prisoner.
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
I don’t know.
God bless my old master.
So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me?
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is.
By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense.
I am no villain.
If you were king, we would do the same.
What about you?
That’s what makes it “sensitive” news.
Now please leave me alone.
At your service, madam.
Tell me, is it missing?
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty.
Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly!
I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!
Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable.
Are these wind instruments?
He’s coming, madam; but he’s acting very strangely.
He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately.
Damn it!
By all that’s holy, here comes Katherina!
No, please.
That’s some nap.
I’ve told you.
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
And why’s that?
Treason!
At the bottom, any change is for the better.
Let’s proceed to the field.
The bridegroom is already here.
Hey, hey!
I think I hear them.
Bandage my wounds!
What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king?
To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset.
Why are you frowning like that?
In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime.
Oh, God help me!
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
You have to be patient with me.
What are you accused of?
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet.
Dear lady, welcome home.
Do you hear me?
My lord, he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day.
He knows I recognize him.
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.
What worries have kept you awake tonight?
Stand back, boy.
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it.
No!
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther.
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman.
Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head.
He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him.
I could swear this is the real Vincentio.  
If you can’t, and would prefer to leave, she’s very willing to say goodbye to you.
Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack?
Madam, I’m here.
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child.
Come here.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
Is the worst well?
You just said they had to face her.
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.
Hail, king!
As moral as me!
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.
So take me to see them.
How sound asleep she is!
Read it.
In Algiers, sir.
I await justice.
You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier.
There we go!
Nothing is what it is.
Fix your example, shepherd.
Run, my lord, run.
Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed.
Here, I give you my blessing again.
There’s only one body here.
I’m coming, don’t worry.
Good night.
I will, lady.
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.
Give me your hand.
My thoughts were never on money.
Good night, my lord.
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
What are you doing, wearing your best clothes?
It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything.
I’ll go and join my men.
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us.
Friends, go your separate ways.
The truth will be all the inheritance you get.
Why, sweet Othello—   I haven’t done anything to deserve this!
Listen, boy!
I can’t get that song out of my head tonight.
Is this true?
How could I forget, my lord!
Alas, he is too young.
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child.
No, my lord, not me.
Please let her speak.
Watch over Signior Leonato’s house; with the wedding being held there tomorrow, there’s a great to-do there tonight.
Please, sir, hurry up.
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.
A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead.
Speak.
Go to him, Sir Topas.
Right on cue, here’s the duke himself.
Call the Duke of Burgundy.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye.
Nobody’s coming?
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music.
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
Can’t help it?
Dorset, embrace Hastings.—Hastings, express your affection for the marquess of Dorset.
The enemy gets larger each day.
I don’t mean that she wants me because  What’s she like?
I’ll answer for you.
Help me here.
It’ll be lunchtime within an hour.
We’ll have a couch made up that’s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful 
Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?
Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her.
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves!
A million goodbyes to you.
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
Is that how the law sees it?
I’ll give the Jew my flesh, blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me.
We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
You know that he does.
Tell me that.
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread!
He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin.
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.
Even if marrying her meant I died.
If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness.
Why?
Well, then, we’re awake.
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully.
I’ll challenge him.
Hello, sir.
Help!
Quiet!
Go away and stay apart from me.
No one passing by?
The king is not responsible for it.
I’ll help out, if only because he speaks the same language as me.
Her eyes are saying something.
With my eye sockets?
His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial.
In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself.
Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell.
I believe you are, Regan.
But go away now.
Like love, my lord, before it learns to love.
If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen.
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.
Bring him to me.
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank!
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Come here.
Listen, Dardanius.
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
What can I do for my lord?
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this.
By St. Paul, ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond’s soldiers could, dressed up in their most sword-proof armor.
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!
I promise I will.
Fa, sol, la, mi.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Is he married?
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.
He only married out of political necessity.
Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.
You don’t know what money can buy.
Here’s some money for you.
Are you on duty again tonight?
Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.
I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted.
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
I’m sure you know him.
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
The graceful and renowned king is dead.
He knows what?
Keep my lover quiet.
When I raise my hand, you do the same, and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head.
What, not a word?
Go to Francis Seacole, the constable of the watch.
She’s not talking to me.
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen.
And there’s no need for wonder or worry.
Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.
Are you the lady of the house?
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.
I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters.
Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.
I wish I could live longer.
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.
His father was Philip of Macedon, as I remember.
What, are you trying to make me crazy?
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
It’s worthless.
While I waited, I’d frown impatiently, and perhaps wind my watch, or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing.
Oh sir, I accept.
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.
Welcome.
Oh, hello, father!
Give me my sin back.
Is it really true?
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
His neigh is like a monarch’s command.
His military understanding is all theory, no practice.
I can’t talk now.
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.
Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
Please, Signior Gremio.
It’s meant in good will.
Peter Quince— What is it, jolly Bottom?
Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
Men who risk everything hope to make profits.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
Where?
So I won’t give or risk anything for lead.
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
Hey monster, the spirit you’ve been talking about, the one you call harmless, has been playing tricks on us.
If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.
You lie.
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?
Protect me, my friends.
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks, torches in their hands.
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results.
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl.
Weren’t you banished on pain of death?
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding.
Definitely a tailor, sir.
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have!
What do you think?
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.
I think they do.
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?
The Prince’s fool”!
If, then, that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar, this is my answer: it’s not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know.
And earth!
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
Did you see that?
Have all his business ventures failed?
Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.
You don’t want to eat, sir?
Ah, how will this all turn out?
As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move.
I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
Or stuff what he says into their pockets.
But where is he?
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th.
You promised to take a full year off my sentence.
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
See how he stands between two clergymen!
You’re not going anywhere.
Oh, lieutenant!
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
And so do I, my lord.
Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest.
When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before.
Farewell, King.
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.
I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido.
Don’t be afraid of her company.
What’s the news, brave soldier?
Let’s call for help and get them tied up again!
The rapier and the dagger.
God have mercy, Grumio!
Who’s shouting “murder”?
I meant a crowbar.
What gentleman?
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.
Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.
Oh, Sir Toby, stop!
Some dungeon.
No one.
I have nothing to do with what you’re talking about, my lord.
Well, I wish you liked me.
Please tell me, who is this man?
Nothing, but this is true.
Shut up, fool.
You haven’t seen anything, then?
You coward, did you run away from me?
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.  
I’d rather be a peddler.
Honestly, I can’t.
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.
My lady Olivia’s inside, sir.
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky.
He’s too good to have any compassion for you.
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.
But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.
No, let them go.
He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit.
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.
Go, but sign the deed.
Signed, she who would be your servant,     The Fortunate Unhappy.” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field.
You piece of filth, you’re lying!
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.
But can I have some hope?
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
And shall our lively blood, quickened by wine, be so frosty?
Thank God and my horoscope!
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.
Your husband.
Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.
know myself!
Sa, sa, sa, sa.
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?
What about it?
Friends, go.
If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other.
I think you’re an ass.
Suffer love!
Well, we were all born to die.
Run and proclaim it in the streets.
Go to the platform, Brutus.
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.
Oh, please be true, please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you, my dear brother!
I’ve told her father, and he’s given his permission.
What a stupid man he’s become!
Why do you say that?
Good-bye.
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man.
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
Please forgive and forget.
I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
Good heavens!
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.
As for myself, it was Greek to me.
My Italy is full of civil war.
I’m not.
Soldiers, watch carefully.
I’m my own spokesman.
Hurry up, it’s getting late.
Is tomorrow the 15th of March, boy?
Yeah, so?
Thanks for that.
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
What is his name?
And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him.
Why, good sir?
You’re too bitter.
May God in His mercy forgive you.
This is healthy talk.
I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here.
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
I’m at your service until death.
In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man.
Go after him and try to calm him down a little.
Why are you bothering this poor man!
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on?
What if I went no further and chose this one?
Let’s get out of here!
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit.
But she, your subject, hates such a king.
I’ll kill him!
No one, Brutus, no one.
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?
And so—?
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.
My story does raise that question.
Madam, not yet.
Come with me, my dear Cordelia.
Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar?
Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.
The river in Monmouth is called Wye, but the name of the other river has gone out of my head.
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me.
Then tomorrow at dinner?
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room?
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe.
A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love.
Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.
It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull.
Speak, if you can.
I am.
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them.
It makes me mad.
Horrid villain!
Taurus!
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
Romeo, are you crazy?
Ha!
And you, sweet Hero?
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself.
When the actors were talking about poison?
Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there?
I don’t even know him.
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?
Damn those men shouting down there!
You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth.
Here comes my little bird.
Let me at him.
If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating.
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.
Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels.
Pinch my nose?
This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time.
May the gods be with you.
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
This is Illyria, lady.
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
For love to appear in his true likeness, he would have to be as Cupid is: naked and blind.
You’re an insolent little boy.
He is a subject for a king to contemplate, and for a king’s king to ride on, and for the world at large—both friend and stranger—to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at.
Just go after him and watch what he does next.
That’s right.
Were you ever at court, shepherd?
Gone, sir.
I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people.
Yes, we get the idea.
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?
I can’t love him.
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other.
My lord?
No, not at all, sir.
I didn’t hear it.
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?
Goodbye.
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Your mistress’s marks?
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
I swear on my soul it was a lie.
Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
What name, madam?
I cannot live without her.
Well then, the beef without the mustard.
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true.
It sang about my crimes.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs.
Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
From Silvius, sir.
He is coming.
It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret.
Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that.
Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on?
I wish we were safely on board our ship already.
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant.
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative, she doesn’t approve of your behavior.
I don’t understand all dat.
Two or three of us have seen strange things.
Where are you all off to?
Call him!
Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!
Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened.
But listen, if 
Help me out of here.
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee.
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.
That’s not fair.
Give me your arm.
You’re a man with a good reputation.
There was no Signior Montanto in our army.
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
Oh, then I guess she was old and gentle, and you rode barelegged, like an Irish yokel.
You should be ashamed, generals!
Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.
But, oh no!
Normally I would ask you what your name is first.
I’m dying to hear your life story, which must be a strange tale.
Oh yes.
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.
Go ahead and ask her.
It’s no time for jokes: sober up.
No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.
How are you, my friend?
Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
Well then, you must be in love.
I didn’t order it.
Why are you giving me his title?
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?
Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.
You’re brave gentlemen.
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
Look after my goods and possessions.
I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.
Yes, heavily.
Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready.
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him, and get him back to Naples, he’d make a great present for any emperor.
The deal is closed.
Get up, I tell you!
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me.
Speak softly.
Go ahead, do your worst.
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord?
Let Rome fall!
You didn’t give me any gold.
Good question, my girl.
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.
I would like to prove to you that I am.
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
Come on, please sing.
A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine.
Be patient, I’m telling you.
Good idea.
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight.
I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans.
Who’s coming with her?
But now I must condemn it.
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen.
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Here, drink to me.
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.
He needs to see you right away.
You’ve kept away from me for a week?
When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears.
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
No, I swear it.
Goneril, are you coming with us?
These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
But no more spooky visions!—Where are the messengers?
I’m doing so.
I swear I never hated you or your father!
May God choose you to receive his grace.
I don’t remember.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield.
Come on, you keep getting paler.
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.
Give us a smile.
You go ahead, and I will follow you.
Are you backing away in fear?
Until her beautiful life’s end.
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.
What, have you forgotten me?
Believe me, I’m not.
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing.
Did he beg my pardon?
Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him.
But I’m not dying yet!
Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.
And how did you get in here?
Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland.
But please forgive me, darling, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.
I’m happy about that.
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss.
I’m off.
Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town, master.
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot?
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you.
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?
If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.
It was.
I’m not drunk.
Tell me, what does he think of our situation?
Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?
What’s with you, my lord?
We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
Get out of my sight!
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.
Let’s go, Nerissa.—
Cobweb.
Say something, man!
Something about Hamlet.
I’ll do it, sir.
Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
It’s even stranger when an angel is so angry.
This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
We’re done for!
Lurk out of sight.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
Relent, and save your souls.
You call it my “ Don’t you know?
Come on, let’s all go inside.
But you’re a famous pirate!
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy.
What do you think, madam?
I am their mother.
Where’s your master, Dromio?
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks.
What soldiers, fool?
Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice.
He’s not standing straight enough to hold a flag.
Yes, madam.
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens.
Is he sane?
Damn her!
I’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger.
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
Do you see?
Alright, I will.
Are your men searching for him?
Amen.
What does she say, madam interpreter?
Isn’t it strange?
Did you hear this, Gonzalo?
We’ll speak again tomorrow.
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you.
Any man can get drunk sometime.
Oh, beautiful and accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!
Was he sent by Count Orsino?
As freely, son, as God gave her to me.
Farewell, and thanks.
Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly.
The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius.
But stop, I say.
You get my point, don’t you?
Good sir, calm down.
The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are.
Hurry up, I say.
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.
No, no.
You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins.
It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because I really don’t love anyone.
Here comes the owner of one piece.
What do you want?
Nice save!
Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen.
What would you like?
Go on.
I’ll do anything you ask.
Tell him I’m sick.
Romeo, come out.
Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing—which will be good for her and even better for me!
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.
That pretty boy, Claudio?
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
What?
He brushes his hat in the mornings.
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for, I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever.
Come on.
There, take it all back—plates, cups, the whole thing.
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors.
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes.
According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night.
He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.
One of you go find the forest ranger.
Find him and tell him to come here.
Come here!
We’re glad to see you.
Capulet, you villain!
Where will we meet in the morning?
If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.
So go.
Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship.
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.
You, sir, where’s my daughter?
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
Ha, ha, ha!
No, add a couple more syllables.
Yes, my good lord.
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets.
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.
Oh God!
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
Sit down, worthy friends.
To hell with your sword.
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
She’s not going to borrow money from them.
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on.
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs.
Many thanks, Signior Gremio.
Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.
Yes, what time is it?
Again!
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds
Are you all good and honest men?
Are you going to take care of this thing now?
Unfortunately, I love myself.
Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”?
And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul.
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!
I do, Mark Antony.
Besides, I have some business to take care of in town.
The watchdogs bark.
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
Come with me, boy.
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
Who does it stand still for?
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
Is he still alive, good uncle?
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.
But oh, what a deceiver he turned out to be!
Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.
I don’t understand.
If he looks serious, he must need money.
If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.
Pindarus!
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
Are you insane?
Cambio.
The weather is fair.
I’m sticking to the contract.
If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.
My life has run its circle.
I’m reminding your grace what you promised me.
What’s going on?
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?
A friend?
I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to.
With that, I’ll be off.
I want very much to find out.
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.
Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph.
First, he sends his regards.
I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.
But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.
Take my advice.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt.
What’s the matter, dear?
As for his cowardliness, ask Fabian.
Why not?
Welcome, good Cambio.
So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life.
Here, take my sword.
Why are they running away?
No, by Our Lady, I’m not such a fool to think what I please, and I don’t please to think what I can, and in fact I cannot think, even if I could think my heart right past thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love.
Good lord!
If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star.
I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth.
But this whole thing is strange.
For you to do it would be good service.
My lord, I won’t miss it.
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?
Polite sir, let me say one thing.
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse.
Sorry, I’m all stuffed.
Is it feasible?
I will.
Oh, my lord!
I swear to you— You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell her that.
I never thought any less of him.
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother.
Your whole family will be ruined.
Drink when I order you, servant-monster.
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
The British forces are on their way here.
Killed?
They’re playing with me.
You hear the charges.
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
Yes, ma'am.
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
It’s better here than outside.
I should really leave right away.
Should we go inside?
A lover would have to be weepier, of course.
Your physical health matters more than your reputation.
Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding.
Come here, captain.
Now go, leave me.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
My own flesh and blood rebels against me!
Ha!
I’ll be with you right away.
I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you. 
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so.  
Enough, Captain.
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison swamps.
His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time.
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Like gambling, sir?
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.
I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!
Stop it, I order you.
I’m hoping for better.
How’s the prince?
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
Which one will start yammering first, Gonzalo or Adrian?
I’m a friend, a friend who knows you well.
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.
Come along with me.
Never apologize—when the actors are all dead, no one can be blamed.
That’s true, that’s very true.
I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers!
Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones.
Is this possible?
What?
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
Ratcliffe, around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor.
Have faith, love me, and you will get better.
Nah, I don’t care what their 
But what’s he like?
Carry him away.
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island?  
I’ll take responsibility for that.
Come on, Iago.
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion.
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair, I hope he gives you a beard!
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.
But tell me what you’re fighting about.
It’s just my bad luck.
And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father.
So, where should we eat? 
Where’s that snake?
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig, her hair as brown as hazelnut shells, and she herself sweeter than the kernels.
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?
Gratiano!
But now we don’t have to!
He must be possessed by the devil.
I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.
But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
Come, night.
How are you, Hero?
Remember me.
The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ My lord!
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.
Quiet!
Are you insane, old man?
But jealous people don’t think like that.
Why not?
What does this mean?
Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use!
Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.
To our house.
Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers.
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.
Please make him change his mind.
Could the lead one contain it?
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.
Isn’t that him?
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”!
His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright.
As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight.
You bastards!
You’re the one I have to obey.
That’s enough for me, then.
Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset.
Are you mad?
I’m indebted to you.
I’m coming in peace.
The king loves you very much.
You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say.
The door’s right here.
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast.
You’re famous for it.
Let’s start.
It sounds more like you’re insulting me.
Let’s drink to our general!
The old guy.
Oh,  Master, master, look!
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy.
Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.
What would you like me to do?
Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled.
It’s “never get tired.” Oh!
I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him.
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.
And you told me to bury my love.
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.
You know what, my lord?
And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch.
Now please go in.
To the breach, to the breach!
I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.
Not the one I gave you, I hope.
Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain.
I’m at your service, madam.
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler.
I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
They shouted three times.
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Anyway, go tell your master I am here.
Who is leading his men?
I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it, but I have a good enough reason.
Wake up when something nasty is nearby.
Motley is the only thing to wear.
He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.
Yet I wish I could.
Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.
Oh, well, stay till then!
Captain Fluellen!
But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can.
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
I think I can guess what you’re about to say.
Say something.
Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him.
I’ve been tricked.
Please, leave me alone.
What’s going on in here?
Please, tell me more.
But I’ll linger.
Well, I’m nearly finished.
Really, he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice.
But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young).
My beautiful warrior!
She is in a better place.
All of them?
Calm down, sir, please.
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
Don’t sleep so close to me.
Exactly.
This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day.
I don’t until you practice them on me.
My lord?
She can’t deny it.
Go away!     
Madam, here comes your husband.
Let me tell
I’ll fix you, I swear.
Agreed.
Be calm!
Was it long or round?
I’m dying an innocent woman.
Let me go, gentlemen.
He does, and now he’s taking revenge on you—for breaking promises and for murder, too.
Not me, believe me.
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me.
I don’t know about that.
They said they were acting for you.
Honest to God, where’s the sexton?
I’m not who I appear to be.
Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.
Tell me one.
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
Calm down, Kate.
I am not made of stone; I am affected by all these kind pleas, though it goes against my conscience and my soul.
I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy.
Did you see the weird sisters?
The only thing different about me is my clothes.
Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame!
We’re on a tight schedule.
Be quiet, Signior Gremio.
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married.
I would rather wrong the dead, and wrong myself and you, than wrong such honorable men.
You’re still here?
Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well, and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things.
Right away, Caesar.
No, it was just a dream.
The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you.
I’m terribly sleepy.
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.
But you must learn to recognize such liars, or you will be greatly taken advantage of.
Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?
What happened, general?
Yes.
Go, tell the Prince.
Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine.
I’m coming, I’m coming!
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them.
And how was that one settled?
If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you.
Oh, was she now?
That’s it—I’m done.
My dearest sister!
If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further.
Here they come.
you will  And what if he won’t stop?
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way.
You have, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander.
Hear me out, my lord.
The money you owe me for the necklace.
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.
Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends.
Let’s go.
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate?
If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash.
I’ve been hurt.
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
And if I, your poor devoted servant, may ask you for one small favor, you will guarantee my happiness forever.
I could have blown up the town in an hour.
Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail.
Monster, I smell like horse piss, which is making my nose pretty upset.
There’s a time for all things.
Signior Baptista, I’m glad to see you.—Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
I’m going now.
You’re right.
Let’s not, Brutus.
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.
Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry.
Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
Good morning, cousin.
For heaven’s sake, help me!
Take me by the hand and say, “Harry of England, I am yours.” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out, “England is yours, Ireland is yours, France is yours, and Harry Plantagenet
It is not courteous, you know, to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking.
I will, sir.
Give him your arm.
Has he, sirs?
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
If not, you can kill me.
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good man.
I swear I’ll smack you if you hit me again.
That he was never trained as a soldier.
I’ve never heard of that.
As my child, I order you to do so.
Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad.
Good morning, my friends.
I wish we had a signed legal contract.
Get going now.
Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.
Mine, too.
You may be exaggerating the risks.
That’s a nice hand you dealt me.
Swear by her foot, so she can stamp out the oath.
Give me your first, Mr. Mustardseed.
We will go in together.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.
Yes, that’s quite likely.
Here’s to you, Menas.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.
Think about it.
Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day.
Don’t say that.
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit.
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
Let’s go.
That’s enough for the senate.
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
I have news from Rome, my good lord.
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
Stop—if you can’t be kind, at least have some shame.
It’s not the right time to play.
Here, my lord.
People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone. 
I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws.
Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you.
I am being serious, my lord.
When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here.
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one.
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you.
But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor.
He was perfect in everything.
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
That’s  Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel?
God bless you!
And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong.
There’s no clock here in the forest.
What if I am?
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.
Who’s shouting?
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!
No, my lord.
Take him safely through the lines.
But I, who have never known how to beg and never had to beg, am starved for food, dizzy with lack of sleep, kept awake with curses and fed with brawling.
What do you mean, get rid of him?
It’s true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter, and she loves him—or else they’re putting on quite an act.
What’s new with you?
Well, should we head to the Tower?
An excellent motion.
He rejected my authority as much as yours.
But don’t be easily won over.
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.  
Then please tell me he’s all right.
Right on time.
Where’s Seleucus?
Be quick about it.
Her husband, you rascal.
Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil.
Take up the sword again, or take me up.
Is he angry?
Kings and noblemen served him.
At least two hours past.
Driven?” Really?
The  It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be.
A king, perhaps— My lord— How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?
Only Antony was at fault.
That’s out of tune, sir.
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey.
Yes, what about it?
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?
In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
Unpunished!
Not yet, cousin.
And there’s another storm brewing—I can hear it in the way the wind whistles.
Who did it?
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!
Being too old to marry someone young.
I’m sure he’s out there dancing.
Then heaven have mercy on me.
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you.
We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing.
As a favor to  I’m delighted.
Goodbye, then.
Take her to my tent.
So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.
Oh, but these are our friends.
You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch.
I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.
Only to watch that title become worthless, as her mother has.
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.
Give me your hand.
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.
Thanks, my good countryman.
Take credit, God, for it is no one’s doing but yours.
Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you.
I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today.
What then?
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house.
Yes, thoroughly.
Did this happen before the King of France returned home?
As Edgar, I’m nothing at all.
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?
And leave us, Publius, in case the people storming us should harm you.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how are you getting on with my daughter?
We will do the same.
The Lord in heaven bless you, noble Harry!
Wake up my whole household!
Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it.
If it pleases your Majesty, it is the token of a man I must fight with, if he’s still alive.
What’s the boy Malcolm?
Tyrrel, come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths.
Wait a minute, gentlemen.
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?
A very nasty meaning.
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.
Down with the Capulets!
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
Anyway, Jessica, go inside.
Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France.
Light the candles!
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
Look!
You can hope your father isn’t your real father.
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it.
You can have it then, your highness.
Did you accompany Caesar home?
Well, may peace be with you.
He’ll just think an idiot wrote it.
My lady, should I lie in your lap?
The king?
I’ve been looking all over for you.
He and I will make up.
Yes, I am.
If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare.
Are you still so cruel?
I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future.
She’s cold.
Fulvia is dead.
Kent’s been banished just like that?
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius.
If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
I’ll limp after you.
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.
I have lived long enough.
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.
Wait, look!
But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.
Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill!
Your logic is so foolish.
It was windy on shore too.
Even the best jewel can be tarnished.
Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business!
Please stand up!
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
And that would get us all executed.
Good morning, sir.
Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.
It’s the devil speaking through him.
I hope we have the time some day!
Let go of my hand.
May a plague strike both your families!
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does.
Do not run away.
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.
I’m sure I can guess.
Go wisely and slowly.
I think so too.
No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus.
What, that’s all?
What is a traitor?
Lord, how you’ve changed!
It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous.
Yes, it’s me.
I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne.
I have a lot to do before noon.
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Most noble Antony!
Shush, sir, please!
You can’t mean it, Tranio!
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently, and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs.
There’s two—a man and a woman.
Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me!
Who, me, my lord?
What’s your name?
The French have retreated, see, and there were great acts of courage.
His daughters want to kill him.
Oh, I’m dying of hunger.
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.
But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake.
Our master and mistress are looking for you.
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
But I guess it doesn’t matter.
Did you find my daughter?
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.
Come, Dromio, let’s go.
You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have.
We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us.
I thank you, Sir John, with all my heart.
This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
From that cabin I’d call out to my soul.
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
Their forces are nearby.
As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life.
I’ll meet you at the ferry.
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.
But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
Well, what’s going on, mister?
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre.
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
Hey, let’s have some music here!
You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.
When a majestic king starts acting silly, then it’s my duty to be blunt.
It’s a measly little cap, a dessert crust, a plaything, a silk pie.
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.
I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide.
It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin.
This is not the way to win your daughter.
You knew my father well; therefore, you know me, the sole heir to all his property and possessions, which I have added to rather than depleted.
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion!
Is my father well?
Get up and tell me how you came here.
These were sweet omens!
Look, if you really love the beautiful Hero, enjoy it.
I slept well, ate well, and was happy.
I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.
I don’t think so.
Excuse me, my lord?
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint.
There was no end to his generosity.
What is your wish with regard to her?
You’re a fool.
Quiet, children, quiet.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
Oh, she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean, and he’s the height of crabbiness.
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
It was two o'clock when I left him, and now it’s one.
The clock has chimed midnight.
Richard loves Richard, that is, there’s just me and myself here.
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack.
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.
I can’t tell who’s who.
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
But who would dare tell her?
Yes.
I can do anything!
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?
Thank you kindly.
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir.
I hope to God I’m proven wrong!
For some reason he’s in prison now on some legal technicality, on Malvolio’s orders.
Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
That’s right, except for the widow Dido.
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
Do whatever you want with it.
Wow, we’re really going to drive him crazy.
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
Thomas, the earl of Surrey, and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers.
Here’s the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, which has been written out in a clear hand, like any legal document, so it can be read aloud in public outside St. Paul’s Cathedral.
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you.
Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
I think few die well who die in battle.
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!
Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed.
What do you mean by “carriages”?
But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures.
Go inside yourself.
Because that’s what you are now.
Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness.
I don’t like that.
And maybe a third?
Oh, no.
Do you really speak like such a gentleman?
If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it.
These corpses suggest mayhem.
That’s a stupid thing to say.
Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace.
Where is that damned wretch, Tranio, who defied me in such a disgraceful manner?
Why, no, sir.
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.
Did you send for him, sir?
Where do you come from?
What’s this part for?
Show her in.  
Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind.
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer.
I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of.
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?
Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death?
I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself.
Let me ask you a particular question.
Hello.
Be violent, bold, and firm.
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
I don’t know what else it could be.
But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich.
Listen, I hear them.
Yes, she will.
Sweet Montague, be true.
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to.
Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry?
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of.
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.
I don’t know him.
Don’t you have one word of joy?
Madam, I will.
What are you going to do?
I remember the plan.
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves.
What can you see out on the ocean?
The second I saw you, my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient log-man.
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you.
Will you have me?
No, my good lord.
Goodbye, my lord.
We’ll mutiny.
Is Antonio here?
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
But are they all safe, Ariel?
You’re not answering my question.
Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up.
That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,            Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie.
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage.
Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders.
From under the earth.
Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”?
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.
She’s the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before.
Excuse me?  
You’re under arrest, sir.
Okay, but please not before me.
Meet with the ambassadors.
With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
Do you remember the circumstances?
Thank you, sir.
Where is that poor rash man?
Yes, he has.
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason.
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?
The king has broken his heart.
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands.
I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats.
I’m everywhere.
You’re lying, you shaggy-haired villain!
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood.
Shall we get to work?
Help!
I gave you everything— And it was about time too.
Where should we meet?
Please, stop bowing, good sir.
Help!
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.
Have they come back?
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin.
Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night.
Here, sir!” You stupid, unpolished dolts!
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.
What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy?
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.
And when she does, he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him.
Farewell.
Set down your honorable load, men, if there is ever any honor in being dead.
You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps.
Yes, that’s the one.
I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars.
Oh, Julius Caesar, you are still powerful.
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.
Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.
That’s good advice.
Goodbye, old friend.
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.
Go to my brother Cassius.
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
It’s time we hit the road.
Goodbye.
I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul.
and patches of righteousness.
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Tell me, don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina?
Go to the church: take the priest, the clerk, and some reasonably honest witnesses.
I wish I had a fault like that!
It’s true, Hero says so.
Good night, you amazing woman, you.
Sir, a word before you go.
Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day.
He swears he used to be a courtier.
Let’s see, how can I
Get out of that position, because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop.
It’s a friend of Antony’s.  
Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled.
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.
I heard him swear he did.
Why does the world report that Kate is lame?
Yes, he is dead.
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents.
What do you think will be the result of this storm?
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.  
Please, be cheerful.
Here I go.
Why?
Knock.
Drunk?
Answer that question.
Is his army approaching?
Dear friends, let’s go to bed.
To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition.
When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness.
I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing.
When you’ve finished, go back to Pompey’s theater.
Besides, I don’t like you.
Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies.
I knew that would be your answer.
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
Go wake Juliet.
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.
I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the 
That’s him, madam.
You should know, my loving lord, I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany, to the earl of Richmond.
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
He is my dear friend, your Majesty.
But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. 
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood.
Should I tell you why?
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody.
As a friend.
I want you.
My poor husband, my dear Edward!
Was this ambition?
Yes, exactly.
Is this well done?
How handsome it is.
Yes, yes.
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.
Which speech, my lord?
If a ship’s leaving, come to the marketplace.
If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.
What a wonderful time to be alive!
I wish I could see this invisible drummer.
In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?
Other than Richard, even those whom we fight against would rather we won.
From our brother monarch, the king of England?
What, everybody falls asleep so fast?
A house, a person?
Go away, now.
Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades.
Here’s more news.
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.
He’s very handsome.
Will you be here when I return?
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly.
But let it go.—Now, Litio, it’s your turn.
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape.
Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.
You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens.
Clearly, men should not go out walking too late!
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
A little before twelve, I think.
What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her.
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is.
I’m telling you, I hardly know myself.
What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
By my sword, Beatrice, you love me.
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.
Like medicine for a sick man.
And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word.
Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
You’ll both help me, right?
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great, I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey’s camp.
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”
We’ll have to think about it carefully.
Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
I will not rise until your Highness hears me.
Listen!
Do you really think so?
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him!
Yes, just now, my lord.
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?
More and more pain for us.
Follow me, then.
Oh, dainty duck!
Then I have offended no one.
Please go inside.
As long as heaven and nature extend it.
That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
I’d like to munch on some good dry oats.
I didn’t, either.
It would be easier to do it in the dark.
Oh, what a horrible day!
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys.
I’ll reward you for your troubles.
Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat.
Alas, our poor country!
I won’t.
That will please God, who has him now.
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.
Well, thank God I’m cured!
Don’t you think so?
I’ll tell you at a better time.
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.
You’re right, sir.
And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.
A drunkard or a corpse?
Is there anything inaccurate in that?
That’s a poor example.
That’s a deal.
What are you fighting about?
Come to think of it, I thought I felt a scab there.
You belong to her.
You know how young my daughter is.
No, my lord, it’s been four months.
Please walk softly, so not even a mole hears us approach.
I’m not myself.
I’ll leave him alone.
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost.
Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once?
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry?
Stop right there, sir.
Come back to my house with me.
If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say.
Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s.
Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly, too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly.
Why do you say that?
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self.
But what love could make my Lysander leave me?
Who’s this Adam you speak of?
My master’s house.
What?
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you.
What do you want?
No, I’ll recite it for you right now: “de hand, de fangres, de nails—” “De nails,” madame.
You know me well.
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging.
Fled to England?
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
Don’t say that, Lysander.
And when is he leaving?
No, listen to it, Antony.
Come on in, tailor.
Oh, there’s my lady!
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.
Or are we both on drugs?
The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed.
of her father.
You’d be a pitiful bird.
Portia is dead.
In an instant we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a daze.    
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
Please, follow straight after me.
I’ve got my answer.
Well, I’m going to break in.
What, you don’t say a word?
They couldn’t, they wouldn’t.
Hang our flags on the outer walls.
My God, this is unbelievably strange.
Good husband, come home soon.
Lend me your handkerchief.
She had no food today and will have none.
I’m not sure, my lord.
Blab my nonsense?
Thank you.
I demand to be satisfied.
And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.
And leave you out?
So get out of here!
Why?
Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window.
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning.
A husband?
Lead the way, sir.
What did you say?
Tonight we’ll have dinner.
But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.
We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
This feather moved because of her breath.
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave?
A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?
If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.
It’s all over now, and so am I.  Let’s forgive each other.
Ready to set sail, sir?
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. 
Don’t be afraid.
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.
Come on, men!
Okay, to the point.
What’s wrong, Hecate?
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together.
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.
That’s Enobarbus?
He’ll kill me with tortures.
Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well.
Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol.
A greater gift?
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
My good King, surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over.
Ah, leave it alone.
But sir, have you married my daughter without my consent?
I knew your father.
Come on, envelope, open up for me.
His position is hopeless.
So let me hear what you have to say.
You must all keep up this united front.
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
I don’t want her.
No, I won’t.
Three-time traitor and whore!
Your husband, being saddled with a shrew, projects his own suffering onto my husband.
Now I see it’s true.
That’s why he hates me.
Not if you want to keep your arms!
I’ll return the favor.
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.
Sir, you’re old.
How can this drama be so many contradictory things?
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
Do you recognize the handwriting?
You can relax, ma'am.
I’m a gentleman.
lain.
But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again.
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.
Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
And I had to be away!
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
Stinking like a swamp.
But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly.
Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you.
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels?
Where is your army, then, to beat him back?
That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do.
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
Come here, sir.
It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
Do your best.
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.
And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants.
Brother, hey!
I wish that were true for both our sakes!
Oh, you’re a clergyman?
Pray you sit still.
See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name.
But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you.
A love song, a love song.
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.
Why, last night.
As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy.
Hello, sir.
This guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that.
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.
So here’s the plan.
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.
Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace.
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.
Two hundred ducats.
He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.
If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.
Your joke is a very bitter apple.
Nerissa’s got the right idea.
That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.
I wish I were as big and strong as you.
Macbeth!
The candle is burning in your study, sir.
I’m glad about that.
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.
What about it?
The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.
To me it looks like a weasel.
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.
It’s been longer, it’s been longer.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Here.
Where was she born?
And when the mind is engaged, the rest of the body, dead and dull before, wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity, like a snake shedding its dead skin.
I’ll leave you for now.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.
Don’t you care about me?
And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin.
But don’t take all that pain on yourself.
We’ve finished our business.
We’ve got to give them and take them, my lord.
I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul.
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
The princes left your daughter here for dead.
He was on his way here with your wife.
Yet he seems capable.
Listen!
As for my daughter Katherine, this much I know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity.
You flea, you louse, you winter cricket!
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye?
Gentlemen, stand up.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
No.
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word.
I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria.
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier?
They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men.
Sweetheart, go on.
It’s not for me to say.
It’s the best thing to do.
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.
And 
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Look at you!
What have you done?
Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.
Please be quiet.
I will, my lord.
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.
Biondello, go and tell your mistress to come to me.
In fact, she’s crazed.
I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest.
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream, and even when you were awake, it was as though you slept.
Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.
I am not in the giving mood today.
Yes, those are the best clothes.
The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman.
Let me destroy myself, let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours, let day remain dark and night sleepless, and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart, clean devotion, and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter.
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
I don’t know what to say.  
This villain is much quicker than I am.
Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege.
That’s not holy, it’s heresy.
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.
Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you.
Hello, do you have any news?
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
But what do I care about words?
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him.
Don’t do it with poison.
And who is England’s king but an heir of the great York?
No more, please.
Saw who?
In his heart?
Right now, my pressing business calls me away.
Yes, my lord, quite well.
The army is ready.
I am indebted to you for your last sermon.
But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?
Love can make worthless things beautiful.
Well, I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing.
Follow her.
Speak, I command you.
Nobody will hurt us.
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
My only sin was loving you too much.
I’m biting my thumb.
Oh, God!
He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.
I came from Corinth, Your Highness.
I’m just stating the facts as I see them.
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.
Not really, unless you were ugly.
He deserves only honor, complete honor.
I’m very glad.
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him.
Can we have some water please here?— Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home.
How is that possible?  
You, will you join with me?
I told him we’ll stay for at least a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer.
I can’t find it.
I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.
Well, explain—but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it.
He builds our fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for us.—Hey!
Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music.
No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in hell.
Oh, I see.
That can’t be.
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.
Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my love—who else do I love so much?
Holy Franciscan Friar!
His insane period is over.
Are you afraid to act the way you desire?
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.
Speak, nephew.
I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
And would I have ever done that to you?
He looks angry.
A  What’s going on?
But leave it all to God.
Even my hair revolts.
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.
You, niece.
And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you.  
No, I’ll be patient.
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body, then good things would fight to live in it.
Don’t reply.
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend?
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself.
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.
I beg you, Strato, stay by me.
You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly.
This is Cinna.
Surrender, dog!
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
No, he’s not.
Fulvia?
I beg your pardon.
Look, it’s waving me over again.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
Now you know the reason for the rush.
Fool!
For the enemy, see—and you can explain this to the duke, see—has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours.
Go take care of him.
Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.
Me, marry her?
Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell.
My friends, listen.
Forgive us, my lord.
To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian.
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.
Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord?
I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.
Wait!
You’re wrong, you madman.
If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience.
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days.
My lord and brother, God save you.
We will wait on you, your majesty.
Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.
Step aside.
If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me, don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down.
I can’t do this.
Messala!
Farewell.
He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here.
Thinking, my lord?
With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal.
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
No, not at all.
So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.
Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders.
When did I say all that?
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.
Oh, help!
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.
She’s Phoebe-ing me.
Lysander, say something!
The king has strictly forbidden it.
We’re wandering in a maze.
Bring him in front of me.
I’ll look into it further.
You’re as wise as you are beautiful.
I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song.
Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it.
If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.
So be quiet.
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
What’s the matter?
Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur.
Come, gentlemen, let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent.
Good morning, Caesar.
Tybalt is lying over there.  
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.
Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first.
I want to go home.
I swear, I love you.
Don’t you, Dromio?
How does she claim to own you?
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us.
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply?
Why, what’s the matter?
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest.
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.
That’s what I conceive of him.
When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am.
Adultery?
You have.
Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first.
However your wit and luck allow.
I don’t think so.
Now come along.
Are you ashamed of me?
Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me.
Who are these men?
I’m not competitive like Antony.
Be quick.
Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose.
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
Orlando.
Just tell me.
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
Not that I know of.
Take him away.
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own.
Daughters who can make you obey them.  
What should I swear by?
Don’t worry about the cost.
He’s somewhere between boy and man.
What kind of question is that!
But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?
No, stop.
But did your sister die of love?
I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for.
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous, hunchbacked toad.
How dare    What, is the man crazy?
Just as tall as my heart.
I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds, to be paid by the shah of Persia.
Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails, or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh.
She  I can guess her answer.
I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.
Oh, are you here, Iago?
Lucius!
Who pleaded with me to pardon 
Stop.
Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
She’s the reason I’m here.
Come on, let’s go see King Edward.
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could.
Sir, that’s well said and well thought out.
I will.
He wants me dead.
What a worthy man!
When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.
Where’s Antony?
The night’s too rough for humans to bear.
We’re wasting time here.
I’ll think of something.
Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not.
Again, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
My lord, you used to like me.
Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers?
Sir!
When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me.
Ratcliffe, my lord, it’s me.
There was even more foolishness, if I could only remember it.
Go to your bedroom.
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.
Come on, give me your best shot.
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!
Speak, man.
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.
Did it really work?
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.
Farewell, farewell.
Well, good night.
I hear someone knocking at the south entry.
Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news.
Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.
She’s probably right.
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.
Curse the day this happened, but it did.
Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you.
If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.
I am Benedick.
Let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth.
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him.
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.
Now there can only be the promise.
So be it.
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny.
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.
What trade, boy?
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will.
For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.
Good Ursula, go wake my cousin and ask her to get up.
On what grounds?
Oh, you evil woman!
Take him off to jail!
I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.
When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.
I know the real reason.
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
We hope you feel better and find some peace.
It’s dark, like my shoe.
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.
I did—and now I’ve got it!
Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.
That really would be kind.
A tailor made you.
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
As for him, I never think about him.
You’re a man?
Huh!
Then Antony offered it the third time.
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.
Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
Not in the stocks, fool.
I’ll get the general’s surgeon.
You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky.
She will wither and come to a bad end.
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
That’s like hot ice and strange snow.
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—
I’m old and foolish.
No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice.
Come on.
Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!
Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become.
Good point, and well said.
Why don’t you answer me, man?
I was born as free as Caesar.
I thank you, lady.
And isn’t your husband an honorable man?
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
Please go inside.
Well, I’m not sorry to hear that, because they have always been my enemies.
Trinculo, watch out.
Boy!
We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him.
It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland?
Come on.
No, sir, she’s human.
I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time.
Are you his friend?
Well, let’s go on.
I also hope that we can be better strangers.
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
I know a terrific wench.
Goodbye, Jessica.
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Your behavior is an insult to all women.
Don’t trust Trebonius.
The court has sent for us.
I think I’m getting delirious.
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!
Yes, indeed, bring them before me.
We are responsible for this. 
Where did you hear this?
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
Yes, but I know— What do you know?
No, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard.
What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you.
I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me.
Look, he’s moving.
It’s best just to let him go.
My strength is all gone, as if in a dream.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.
I don’t see any blood.
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
His name!
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner?
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
I can’t say no.
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
We rejoice to see you, most worthy brother of England.
And there comes Caesar.    
Authority.
Let’s go back to our bedroom.
Shame on you, Demetrius!
Good morning, gentlemen.
Never trust me again if I don’t.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in.
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know.
You will love more than you are loved.
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves.
Have you both really given me up?
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.
But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia!
You won’t be seeing anything.—Hold his chair still, men.—I’m going to put my foot on his eyes.
I am a villain.
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day.
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
Look, here it is.
Who’s there?
Damn my soul if these accusations are true!
You’re making such a fuss.
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
Where are you going?
And your experience makes you sad.
My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death.
Please allow her to do this.
What do you mean, your highness?
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
Go find out the news.
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away.
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from?
Got it, sir.
Say, uncle Richard, if my brother comes, where will I stay till my coronation?
So were you.
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions.
My situation is desperate.
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse.
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them the prime suspects.
Your crown is crooked.
Sir John Falstaff.
That dirty rat!
Be at ease.
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, and he’ll say that you’re sick today.
Sir, I think I saw him last night.
I go, Caesar.
Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
He doesn’t miss a thing.
Yes, sir.
You’re too forgiving.
Hello, sir.
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
Brutus, do not provoke me.
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today.
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs.
And  I feel that I love her.
His son was a minor only two years ago.
As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance.
I wouldn’t allow any commerce.
But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house.
Listen.
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar?
Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels!
There!… And over there!… And over there!
How’s the night going, boy?
If he’s ready now, so am I.
What are you saying, mistress?
Look!
Thursday is coming.
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
The world is a bad place, where you can’t speak what you know.
Is Horatio here too?
Good-bye.
Well, God bless this marriage!
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.
A good fool.
I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort.
We’ll see them immediately.
What proof is there?
My plans take me a roundabout way.
I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet.
Why are you so sad?
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy?
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
You’ve forgotten the will I told you about.
Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man.
Truly, lady, you have a merry heart.
Oh, deadly sin!
Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him.
He brings me freedom.
I’ll recite something for you, guy.
Yes, he did.
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn’t know that our situation was secure?
Why not?
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps.
Me neither.
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything.
Oh, how silly we are!
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan’s pipe.
But a dream itself is just a shadow.
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s: she
Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to 
Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him.
And this is all because of our argument.
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.
You’ve stunned him.
Of course I hear it.
And look, here’s Publius, come to fetch me.
Oh, immortal gods!
I beg your 
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory.
Fool, fool, hey, fool!
I’m strong-willed.
Meet me at the synagogue.
I know I can do it.
Go get money.
Is everyone here?
Don’t wrong her birth.
Oh, yes, we could, sir.
Here’s the hut, my lord.
Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions.
If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
Well said!
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds.
Who?
Banquo!
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner 
Are we bothering you?
I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
If we don’t obey them, they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue.
Good-bye.
Tell us about this wrestling.
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
I don’t know.
Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me?
No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that.
You don’t need eyes to see how the world works.
Go ahead.
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.
Will I hear from you soon?
How could that happen?
Where is my wife?
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw.
Well, at least that’s something.
Can you ask around and find out?
I’ll have nothing to do with you.
They say the horses ate each other.
He’s the color of nutmeg.
Watch me like a hawk.
I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.
Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head.
I shall faint.
She provides an excellent moral.
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England.
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.
Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless).
I tell you, you can use it to get your shoes fixed.
Good madam, restrain yourself.
Hello and God bless you, sir.
Prepare yourselves, generals.
Can’t you see for yourself?
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.
You must go to Parthia.
If you knew the reason, you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.
He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies.
Here’s what you’ll do.
That’s a lame answer.
I’m Trinculo—don’t be scared—your good friend Trinculo.
What do you say to that, Malvolio?
I’d tell them that I saw natives like these—since they must be natives—who are graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at, kinder than most human beings you might find— kinder than almost any human.  
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone?
I’m sorry to hear this.
If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it.
Bring down that top sail!
Listen!
Are you good at those kinds of things?
Good Lord!
Come, driver!
Horns?
Your features, God help us!
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.
Romeo?
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks?
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.
I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving.
Look, sir, I’m bleeding.
I dreamt about this.
Just a man, like any other.
Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited?
Where have you been, boy?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
That’s more than we know.
God help you, foolish man.
If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.
Yes, that’s it.
I don’t deny it.
It’s always like this in times of change.
Let’s listen to him.
Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss.
If she glares, I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew.
My son will win.
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry.
I don’t believe it.
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you?
Would you like to taste the banquet?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
No, he refused it publicly, in open court.
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed.
What’s your name, please, friend?
Is the building of your love already in ruins?
Where is my lovely bride?
Know him?
Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.
Why, what do you imagine his name to be?
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
Where’s my son Edmund?
It’s late.
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again.
Also, he’s left you all his walkways—in his private gardens and newly planted orchards—on this side of the Tiber River.
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself.
Why are you doing this?
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?
Well, give me the worst news.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Go inside, Nerissa.
You gave an excellent performance.
No, gentle madam.
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around?          
Hello, spirit!
How about it, Corporal Nym?
You’ll be back at two o'clock?
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
Look at you getting all riled up!
I know where he is.
The night has been chaotic.
Exactly how long is that, do you think?
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
Yes, sir.
Come in out of the storm.
What, are we having a feast?
That’s unbelievably bad.
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions.
I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king.
I’m satisfied.
I wonder what it means.
Knock, knock, knock!
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Why are you talking to me like this?
Our Queen is dead too.
Come on, I’ll take you, but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity.
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you.
Cheer yourself.
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it.
Welcome, my friends.
Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love.
You won’t get any bad cooks from me.
By God, I will tell the king about these taunts.
Who, him?
If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect.
No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.
I’m being repaid for that now.
jailer, i’m your prisoner.
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look.
Let’s stay and watch.
Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband.
Did he ask about me?
What do you mean, lady?
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
They’re overdoing it.
And I followed him because I loved him.
Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself.
And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk!
The Tower’s chaplain has buried them, but to tell you the truth, I don’t know where.
I’ll follow you.
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Why?
Do you like her, Claudio?
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.
You know what I intend.
Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?
Yes, sir.
Did you have to give them everything?
Can he deny it?
Hey, love, I say!
I swear to God it’s true, sir.
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man.
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master.
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
Never.
In Orsino’s heart.
I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.
You have to stop talking like this.
Is it out of lust?
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.
Be silent and go in.
That’s just what I thought.
My back aches too—
If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
These are gracious tears.
That’s what the bill says.
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?
Convince him that he has been out of his mind—and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord, I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him.
I heard the news, my lord.
It’s torture, not mercy.
And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
What does this mean?
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
Virginity makes her look sick and green.
What, you want them to weep our horses' blood?
Yes, husband.
Who pays their way?
My master and my lord!
Why, then, should I cry?
Good morning, worthy Caesar.
Welcome.
Watch Cassius.
Get out of here, you blathering peasant!
Before your sentence has been completed?
He doesn’t know what he’s saying.
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you.
But did you tell him she cheated on him?
But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own father—if my wits don’t fail me.
Here, you there, Grumio.
Don’t you have any respect for anything?
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust!
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
That was nothing.
I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently.
Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.
Welcome home, Grumio.
What, you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about?
He discovered that the man was his older brother.
Tell me, Othello.
Leave me.  
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
Stay there and fortify it well against the French.
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface.
Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them.
When I was putting on the Ceres show, I thought of reminding you about Caliban, but I was afraid of upsetting you.
It may be so.
I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.
Go with me to the tomb.
Play your flutes!
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message.
She’s not good enough for you, then.
You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.
Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines.
He’s dead.
Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse.
This is what happens when you visit whores.
Don’t be scared.
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?
But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them.
Wait!
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.
I’m not sure about that.
It’s too bad.
Lucentio, sir.
I can’t stand her.
Lead them inside.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Yes, sir, I have.
Brutus, may I have a word with you?   
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt.
Let go of it!
What money, sir?
Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind.
He begs you to spare his life.
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
That since she’s mad herself, she’s married a madman.
Good, very good.
What’s happening now, Lucillius?
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
It’s born of my  A witty mother!
Who put my servant in the stocks?
Oh, no.
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
Leave me alone now, Iago.
Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?
Where’s your sparkle now?
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her.
With whom?
Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.
Oh no!
What, are you mocking me to my face?
Around three or four o'clock, look for news from the meeting hall.
Look, here comes the duke.
When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body.
You are too evil for words!
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind.
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.
I feel sicker and sicker.
Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons?
The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants.
Please calm down, uncle.
Against my brother Lucius?
It’s still waving to me.
I don’t mean he’s 
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with.
Ha, banishment?
My sweet Cassio!
What garment would your Honor like to wear today?
But how long will “ever” last?
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
And she screamed at me, right?
He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter.
Are you coming monster?
He’s lying through his teeth!
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
Oh, kill me!
Don’t come in here, uncle!
Cheer up as much as you can.
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.
Where is the fool I sent on ahead?
Now, soldiers, advance.
I recognize his trumpet.
I can’t believe it.
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad.
It’s a lie, you thread, you thimble, you measurement!
So please listen to me.
Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home!
I hope so.
We’ll win yet.
If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.
Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble.
My vision is dull.
Did he charge interest?
My liege.
I’m headed for your niece, sir.
Isn’t it past two o'clock?
It’s getting there.
Go back with her?
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say?
Stop crying.
My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
Yes, you are.
I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin!
Who are you?
Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
What you wanted is yours.
If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.
You evil whore!
A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work.
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see.
Good Lord, what a clown you are!
Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon.
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus, begging from his knees?
Then there’s the Count Palatine.
Be quiet, people!
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
Goodbye to my happiness!
That’s right.
Uncle!
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
I was engaged to both of them.
Yes, a little too sweet.
Agreed.
Who are you?
Good-bye.
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.
Who offered him the crown?
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.
I have a  That’s from lack of sleep.
Give me too much of it, so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving.
Come, find the conspirators!
Good point, Decius.
Knock at the gate?
Never, Iago.
Bring them to me.
What, my lord?
Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Music!
You must have figured out who I am.
I’ve finished it for you, and it ends in “Margaret.” He’s turned your curse against you, Margaret.
It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior.
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself.
And who are you, good sir?
If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably.
I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.
I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son.
Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne.
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.
Don’t damn yourself.
Is it because of 
Yes, for three months.
Tear him apart, tear him up!
Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead.
Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.
What kind of man is he?
What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had.
Oh, my dear Cassio!
Where are you, Demetrius, you arrogant bastard?
You want me to say what I’m thinking?
Come with me, sir.
Is he standing or sitting?
My master’s decision.
The house will be so much quieter.
Listen!
He commanded me to wake him up early.
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
I’ll be right next to you.
Let’s go forth, dear countrymen.
God give him health.
What are you waiting for, lords of France?
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them.
I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him.
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
Macbeth!
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid.
How can I help you, sir?
Now this is where you come in.
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll join you.
You’d better think up a way to defend yourself.
This is how the candle burned the moth.
I know it’s the sun that shines so bright.
I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.
And what about that?
Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.
Or should I say it’s her uncle?
That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants.
Is that really what you meant?
Oh, one child is one too many!
It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble.
And  Madam, with all my heart.
Oh God, he’s murdered his master!
Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch.
By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this.
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined.
It was obviously a hit.
Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.
Not explicitly, but so what?
Too fast is as bad as too slow.
Indeed, my lord.
That’s a good point.
Hero is his only child, and his only heir.
Oh, sad day!
The whole time.
Do you think so?
Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die.
The wisdom of your loyalty, fair Bianca, has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner.
I’m not going to waste any more time with you.
He says she has no equal.
Let’s speak to him.
Stay where you are.
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it.
Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.
All right, I will.
What do you want me to do with this?
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
Go up there and second his petition.
It looks great.
It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death.
Will you let me?
Then leave her, sir.
Give me your arm.
If you hadn’t shown up on cue, my lord, Lord Hastings was going to take your part—I mean, he was going to speak for you—in the crowning of the king.
You did—not just once or twice, but twenty times.
Be brave like the lion and proud.
It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves.
This was the basket.
Where is he now?
Well, that’s really my job.
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret, Hero’s servant woman, likes me.
Ever since you lost yours.
If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you.
Here, take the ring.
But it can’t help either!
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.
What endeavor, Popillius?
No, sir, not at all.
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.
Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad.
That was a fine fanfare, boys.
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
Please put up with my weakness.
I must go report what happened.
Well, time will tell.
Your praise has beaten you home.
The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love.
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.
Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
Please go.
Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.
Let me gather my wits and get serious here.
Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.
But quiet, be quiet a minute.
I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
I can see what’s in broad daylight.
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.
Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm.
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals.
Yes, boy.
Who should begin?
You’d think everyone was asleep.
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
What Tranio did, he did at my command.
I think she’ll be a better soldier.
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.
But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it.
You think she gave it to Cassio?
For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it.
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy, my lord.
That’s for sure.
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.
Tell us, Othello.
Really, I’m only pretending to be him.
What is your name?
What do you mean by that, Malvolio?
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
She can stay at her father’s house.
Haven’t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger?
There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky.
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think?
Go to my room and put on something of mine.
We’re men beached on the sand, hoping to be washed out by the next tide.
This is the Dauphin’s message.
As eagerly as I ever came from school.
I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich.
Did you hear her speak?
Now, good-bye.
Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.
Don’t talk to me.
It’s strongest in the strongest people.
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus.
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
Good luck.
This is a sleepy tune.
Upon the king!
Tell me, you monster, where is my son Lucentio?
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed.
It’s very strange.
Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child?
Yes, sir.
No, I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men.
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
He does hear me, and that makes me cry.
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed.
I hope you’re not trying to cheat me.
He couldn’t see you.
Yes, good fool.
The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion.
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.
I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger.
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece.
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair.
Where’s your master?
If things go well, bring the crowd to  I’m off.
Wait good Nurse.
Because their business lies outside the home.
I’m not in the mood.
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it.
I’ll get back at him another way.
I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.
Well then, good bye, my lord.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
Oh, be quiet.
No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest.
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave.
I like it better than laughing.
Its own color.
No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body.
That’s cowardly and womanish.
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.
What’s going on, Rosalind?
Can you tell me?
No, sir.
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?
I’ll do as you say, father.
So, perhaps, did yours.
A good laugh.
He was in bed with— With her?
Definitely not.
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving.
Would raise babies and clip coupons.
There’s a knocking at the gate.
That’s all I wanted to know.
Stop, even if only to kill me.
You are welcome for his sake.
I’m tired of you.
Twenty-five, sir.
Take me to Octavius.
Where’s the Master, Boatswain?
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
A pretty pathetic monster.
Speak once again.
No, I’d rather you stayed here.
If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news.
Good-bye for a while.
Every month he has a new best friend.
And we’ll leave together, like friends.  
Why?
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me.
With all my heart.
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
Kneel, Romans, kneel, and let’s wash our hands, up to the elbows, in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords.
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance.
He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more.
He’s starving me to death.
He is the prince of horses.
Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness.
With a hand like this you need to
I’m very glad I came to see you.
He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.
And good ones, too.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you.
Knock, sir?
What miracle will he work next?
Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight.
You’ll beat me?
joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy.
Your wit is so forceful, it frightens the very meaning out of your words.
Enough of this.
So come with me.
I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace.
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
Not a chance!
Good spirit!
Who does time amble for?
An era of universal peace is about to start.
Stop hollering, man!
Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.” My lord, you’ve won me over this time.
Is that the law?
I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?
Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto.
Bring in more wine!              
Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing.
Did you say Caesar fainted?
Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face.
I’m going to rest my head on this little slope.
You may think that I don’t love you.
Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse.
The next person to strike again dies.
Sir, I think I have the right to speak, and speak I certainly will.
Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
It took me two years before I had a single tooth.
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making the pine tree open and let you out.
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me.
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice?
I don’t know.
I brought you here from Venice.
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?
The king’s in bed.
My sons Edward and Clarence!
God bless your Worship!
You’ll never hear from the herald again.
Where, where?
Very well.
With all my heart, I’ll join you.
Be patient until I finish.
That’s the way to show me friendship.
Do you even know what you’re talking about?
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
What, from myself?
The people fear me in the country and the town.
Whom should we look for in the castle?—Whose job is it?
Will you come with us?
Read the will!
I’ll go tell the king about this.
She’ll be buried with her face upwards, then.
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.
I don’t think so, my lord.
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.  
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot.
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.
Come on, come on.
Yes, my lord.
Is he still alive?
Rise, princes, and, with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords, rush to the battlefield: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; you dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois.
I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.
And now they’re both gone.
Were you born here?
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
Then that’s the way it’ll be.
Listen to Antony.
Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
Some are born great—”
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.
Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her.
I can’t explain it.
How are you, my golden girl?
He can’t like her very long.
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
But I say amen to everything she said.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
Not true, not true.
I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it.
If only I could spit poison.
You can’t do that.
But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.
Oh, these fools!
You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan.
Ride to Salisbury.
Bring Desdemona here.
Oh, will it never be day?
Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days.
I’m glad to see you go.
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
I’ll wait over here.
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him.
They can’t move till you release them.
You too.
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur.
The moon sets at twelve, right?
No, go ahead and take my life.
Carry him gently to bed, and every man be ready at his post when he awakes.
Can a good thing hide itself?
What will you give us?
Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind.
Yes, what about him?
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?
If you dare to fight today, come to the field.
No more foolish talk.
So don’t spend one night away from this house.
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.
Has my master returned yet?
Do you know the way to Dover?
I want to hear more about this.
No, with Demetrius.
So I’m free.
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
And what if they won’t go?
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age.
He’s coming, ma'am.
Her
You’re a bitter fool.
Should I do it now?
That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two.
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.
Or at least I can describe the rumors.
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured.
Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams.
No, afterward.
How did you two get separated?
The person who suffers alone suffers the most.
No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
Nobody delivered it, my lord.
Sir, welcome to our house.
Here, sir!
But please tell me, who’s his best friend?
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim.
You’re shaking with emotion.
Sir, I’m upset.
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone.
We’ll leave you here. 
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much.
Only three so far?
I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason.
Bellario sends his greetings.    
What’s that?
Actually, it’s my arm.
And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow.
Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed.
Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it.
I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable.
One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death.
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
What a long night this is!
Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down.
Never, my lord.
Who sent you this time?
If you’re smart, you’ll go home.
Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.
Oh heavens!
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen.
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
Good Cinna, take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits, so he’ll find it.
In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.
But it is his handwriting?
Thank you, dear Nurse.
No, don’t even mention him.
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.
And so, good morning to all of you.
Do you really mean that?
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
But don’t do that.
Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals?
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch.
I swear that gown’s for me.
That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty.
I’d like to introduce you to my friend.
Welcome, sir.
Have you heard anything to the contrary?
I curse him, but he loves me.
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.
I’m not insulting you.
Eat.
Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.
Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor.
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.
Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman.
Your fate awaits you.
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.
Not a bit, madam.
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.
He’ll never agree to that.
Sing it tonight.
Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced.
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.
It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.
Get to the point, since we already know the truth.
You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way.
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?
It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave.
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe.
You look tired.
And he challenged you to a duel?
Love?
Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell?
Wife!
Tell me.
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
Orsino.
In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused.
You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him.
But please don’t let any of your people wake me up.
There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it.
I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun.
His attendants are desperate, violent men.
That I won’t stand for.
You’ll have to leave tonight.
It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety.
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.
Oh no, not if you say it right.
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!
He’s certainly crossed the river Somme.
I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church, if it’s at all possible.
Now, you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August’s labors, get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here.
Get down and swear it.
Now I go, a jolly, thriving wooer, to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter, Elizabeth, because I know Richmond has his eye on her.
Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?
Want?
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?
Make the best use of this information you can.
Oh, I’ll rest here forever.
I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think.
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
Oh, except for the widow Dido?
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?
Me too.
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people.
What’s going on?
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly.
Well, good luck!
What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.
You can have a whole story, not just a word.
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality.
It’s nice to see children playing well together.
You say you’re a better soldier.
He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.
Quiet!
Hello!
Her name is Portia.
Let’s dance to “You Jerk.” You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”?
Farewell.
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.
Oh, don’t touch me.
person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined.
After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.
They were paid to betray their master.
Why are you calling me “love”?
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.
But now it’s stopped.
Listen to what the tyrant says.
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard.
Who are you?
He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son.
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband.
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.
They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there?
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no part in the killing, will benefit from his death—receiving a share in the commonwealth, as you all will.
I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding.
He’s been killed.
Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start.
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
How did she get that candle?
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
Oh, cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe, or I’ll faint from this deadly news!
Go to the harbor immediately!
I’ll die  You’re of royal blood, and we obey you.
Please come with me.
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help?
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying.
She’s a lot like you.
I’ll tell him, my lord.
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.
My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder.
And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms.
I must be gone.
What a miracle!
to have a stupid wife.
Yes, kind sister.
I was ordered not to.
And me too.
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.
Soon we will toast around the table.
I will sit here in the middle.
I’m going to cry.
With who?
The devil in him is strong!
His name is Balthazar.
Soundly, my lord.
Goodbye.
What do you want?
And yet, against all odds, I win her over!
But why aren’t you in your shop today?
The son ran away.
I have no more royal sons for you to murder.
Thank you.
Give me my armor.
Not a word.
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition.
I like this girl!
And does she have to die for this?
I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple.
His drugs work quickly.
I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love.
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease.
I can’t speak anymore.
How can this be?
I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less.
Take him away.
Then run away.
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
Believe what?
Come, help me bang on the door, master.
Just come again tomorrow.
That’s enough.
Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect.
They’ll tell all.
See how well she can turn?
Hey, you!
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.
I’ll drain the life out of him.
Please get him, my friend, I beg you.
Tranio got you that time.
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
Oh, I’m dead!
Do you think so, spirit?
Who measured the ground?
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.
He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him.
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.
And as wise as a goose.
Say what you want, but I know what I know.
Good-bye.
What a backward world we live in!
Take him to my sleeping area.
And when will that be?
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
What horrible thing are you imagining?
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
We will speak about this further.
Oh, I don’t know.
You kiss like you’ve studied how.
And I think this is his house.
You’re better off because of your friends.
Well put, Maecenas.
Why, Fool?
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter.
Therefore my sadness is without limit.
What kind of game is this?
Start without me.
Cheer up.
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.
Is that possible?
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer.
To find you.
And to you, good sir.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.
I’ll do my best, madam.
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad.
It’s a monster!
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?
My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you.
All three of them are crazy with despair.
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
The storm separated us.
It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience.
I will, sir.
We’ll perform all the holy rites.
With that, I hope God is with him!
I’m just wandering, with no particular destination.
There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks.
Please stay seated.
Yes, your Majesty.
Your peace of mind depends on him.
Andrew Aguecheek”
What, you?
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed.
You tell her, widow!
Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset.
A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless.
The taming school?
Go ask.
Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak.
I got it from you—I never said I didn’t.
The East is very seductive.
Say something.
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?
Oh!
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her.
I say a devil.
Will you play this recorder?
She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived.
You’ll see, I promise you.
Come, blade, drench my breast with blood.
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her.
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin.
A grave?
To the field!
There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.
But in fact it doesn’t say much.
I’ll do all that.
Give me the daggers.
Stay here at your own risk.
Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back.
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service.
Their hounds are unequaled in courage.
Come on, brother!
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury.
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
What should I do that I’m not doing?
Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?
Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion.
Sit down and rest.
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
Please stay below deck, sir.
Did you speak to him?
Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds.
You’re like the poor cat in the old story.
I’m always happy to hear about brave men.
Think about the ones who have died.
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation.
Do you need something?
How are you, sir?
Macbeth!
I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven!
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head.
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together.
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it.
You promised to tell me.
Keep listening.
When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping.
This isn’t the death of one man.
My lord!
What, my dear lord?
Soldiers, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance.
You don’t look well, Antonio.
Madam?
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!
So I’ll stay here for a while.
There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.
Thanks for your trouble.
What do you want?
No, not a bit.
Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order.
Leave out the water.
My baby hawk?
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
Now, herald, have the dead been counted?
Why are you talking like this?
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically.
He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how little English I speak.
We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
That’s true, they are.
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
Thirty ships.
You can stand in his place.
Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur.
Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law.
Let’s follow them to see how this turns out.
I just want everything to be all right between you.
Then how will we see their own natural tears?
Here’s another, stronger than the first.
There’s something else.
Othello?
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else.
I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom.
Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself!
My lady would never want to lose him.
Not by the likes of you!
That’s not good.
Good running, Thisbe!
Love each other and be friends, like two such men should be.
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.
Goodbye, Launcelot.
That’s true.
Madam, good night.
You’ll have your answer soon.
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants.
I’ll use it for fish bait.
Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying.
Why, our troops amount to three times that.
I pitied you, worked hard to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing practically every hour.
I’ve been poisoned.
I’ll make Oliver find him.
Whom do you serve under?
If I can bear that pain, then I can bear my husband’s secrets.
Look at my face.
Well, I’ll go to Scone.
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind.
But if
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
Oh, and I know who loves him.
If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.
Well, that’s the same thing.
I’ve had enough of this “off with you!” Come on, let me in!
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
Go away.
You get only one round.
My lord?
Look, my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me.
Why, here is the order to prove it.
Then you might as well say they’re not dead.
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.
I think he’s got the money.
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat.
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him!
What’s it to you?
And I’ll go to bed at noon.
The man in the moon!
Oh do-de, do-de, do-de.
And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
We have consented to all reasonable terms.
Chop off his head.
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.
Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing. 
Is your name William?
I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks.
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
Even good men have bad luck.
Fine, but not enough.
If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him.
If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were.
I have a ship full of treasure.
You never heard of the Centaur?
piece of cheese will get him.—I challenge you to a match.
Mistress!
Hunt them down.
Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried.
You must be crazy to say that!
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.
Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean.
Hey, naked guy— Poor Tom’s chilly.
Were you talking about Juliet?
I wish some god could help me choose!
What are you doing here in Elsinore?
Here, Peter Quince.
Just give me a moment, please—only a moment.
That was too much.
Goodbye, dear Father.
Fortune is happy today and, in this mood, will give us anything we want.
Your lieutenant, Cassio.
Come, come, I know what you’re referring to, Richard.
Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome.
However, I’ll do what I can for you.
I’ll come too.
You’re hitting close to home there.
Sir, I’m half-blind.
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
A god of a god?
Not in my husband’s nose.
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks?
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
I’ve sent for him.
But tell me, are you speaking seriously?
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels!
Armed forces have already landed.
Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.
Metellus Cimber?
Fool!
Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper.
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
She has the stones on her, and the ducats.” I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
No more than twenty-five.
Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through.
Which one of you killed the deer?
You saw my master wink and laugh at you?
Neither will I.
I will, my lord.
No more, no more.
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
Is this possible, my lord?
Come, let’s be off!
It’s dangerous out there.
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way.
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord, your king, your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land.
First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.
How can a tailor make a person?
No, not at all.
And don’t be proud.
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero.
Come, lady; you must die in order to live.
Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you.
The thane of Fife had a wife.
Oh, I’ll beat him up for that!
Let’s go!
I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next.
Quiet!
I see you like to make big offers, sir.
Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself?
That’s true, my lord.
The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
If I have killed your children, I will have children with your daughter.
And mine say two hundred.
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.
You can’t stay here any longer.
Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime?
Now everyone be seated, as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat.
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut.
Whatever kind you want, I guess.
Put your sword away.
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
He is called Ensign Pistol.
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
Not yet.” Well, the time has come.
How are things now?
That was excellent, really excellent.
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
Oh, monster, we know secondhand clothes when we see them.— Take off that gown, Trinculo.
Tell me why you did it.
You’ll do no such thing.
But not in heaven.
What’s more, people at the 
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
I’m not insane, Sir Topas.
Oh, I know.
Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.
What a wise judge!
Don’t pardon that.
He’s very bright.
Civil wounds now can heal, and peace can live again.
The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream.
You will.
Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?
Things are what they are.
I’ll drink as much as you do!
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
I’ll commute your death sentence.
Today our hopes are at an end.
I’ll be at your service.
The container of that great soul is now cold.
I had no reason, no reason.
Lay out the gown.
Will no one back me up?
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
Get ready, my lord.
Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.
Wait, good Beatrice.
I’ll stop at every house.
You stay on the left.
If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can.
You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing!
Stop right there!
Is that enough of an answer?
But let him start off easy by killing one of us.
But oh, poor Glou-cester!
You and I, and honest Casca, we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen.
I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?”  
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, while I with equal affection welcome yours.
But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive.
Coward!
None, my lord.
Who was with them last?
Will he bring his army?
It’s too hot.
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave.
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
Good afternoon, fair lady.
Farewell.
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
But our courage should only be the greater for that.
But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
Maybe he’s not feeling well.
Welcome back from Mantua.
He’d really be your proxy if he married you.
And the greatest sorrow is mine too.
God will free you from blame.
Oh, the poor man!
If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you.
My lord?
Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over.
Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman.
The hand of death has taken him.
Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,
I’m not asking you to call her.
Saint Davy’s Day has passed.
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city.
She’s not feeling well.
If  Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s funeral.
What do you say, James  Well, I don’t know what to say.
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
Buckingham, I need to have a word with you.
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.
But who’s with him?
And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do, after I’m done.
He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me.
honor you.
He’s in  They say he cried out against sherry.
Command this man to leave.
Yes, she said that.
It’s not yet daylight.
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.
Please do, madam.
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.
That’s burglary, that is.
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
Come on.
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason.
Therefore, love each other in moderation.
At dinner.
Oh, I wish I were a man!
I’m glad to see you.
It’s not earlier than that, I tell you.
No!
Tell me.
How is my lord?
Take good care of him.
Agrippa, go start the battle.
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us.
May I kiss your feet?
On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart with vows of love, but not one vow was true.
I’m torn.
I have done the deed.
That’s good advice.
Why bother with them?
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Put a lot of cash together.
I’ll also wear this in my cap.
Good to see you, Corporal Nym.
I never saw her till now.
Hush, Grumio.
Yes, very well.
I’m still a virgin.
You’re giving him a present?
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
Why are we talking about this?
I’ll meet you at your tent.
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
Besides, he brings his fate with him.
No more than I do yours.
I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.
Here.
Why, would that have fixed my hair?
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
No, not for all of Venice.
He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me.
The one who makes her queen, of course.
Herald, spare yourself.
That’s what Fulvia told me.
I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal.
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you.
Hold on a second.
That’s definitely too old.
Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut.
If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured.
Take it to heart, Dorset.
I don’t know, madam.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
Good to see you, Master Antipholus.
Not many, and no one important.
I know my rights.
She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero!
Here in the tent.
When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you.
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems.
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
How’s everyone in Verona?
Now, your gown?
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves.
What, are you crazy?
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal.
Are you going to get me in trouble?
Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness?
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon.
Was he sad or happy?
I’ve told you everything I know.
You’ve got something for me?
Well, go along now.
I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.
Oh, how brave of you!
Who says he is?
Have you not spoken to her since then?
Just look.
And is “pig” not the same as “great,” may I ask?
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.
I would choose to take my penalty.
Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow.
How’s it going?
That’s what’s driving her crazy.
Since the wall is conscious, it should curse back at him.
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.
Do you love me?
Why are you talking about robbery?
I’ll do so.
After you.
And I your servant.
What do you think?
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!
I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead.
And you’re right to do so.
Sir, I tell you that we are not.
I’ll go too and make sure that happens.
For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!
Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.
I’m out of patience.
Tybalt was my nephew!
All right then.
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse.
Why are you treating my sister like this?
I’ll tell them where you come from, though I don’t know who you are or what you want.
Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.
You’re right.
If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it.
The answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.
I didn’t call you.
Okay, now I’m dead.
Are you Tyrrel?
Hail!
Calm down, calm down.
They 
Listen to our horses neighing, longing to be working.
I can’t tell you anything else.
Let him become Caesar!
I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone.
There’s more knocking.
Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man.
The earth sings when he touches it.
I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more.
But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too.
We want to hear it, Antony.
Conrade, I say!
A fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son.
Yes, every man forward.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.  
Some to Ligarius’s.
I bet my life on it.
Liberty!
Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal.
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.
Is that called for in the contract?
Please pardon our brother Clarence.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it.
Oh, and young men never die?
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
You call this house dark?
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.
Your lives are over.
What’s that trumpet?
Tom’s chilly.
Look, love, see how devoted I am?
He’s a very proper man.
And don’t say all of that yet.
My Lord of Norfolk— Here, most gracious king.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
But how?
Go find him, please, and bring him to my tent.
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— Here, ma'am.
Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.
But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed.
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
That’s enough about that.
He may recover yet.
Whoosh!
You scolded him in private?
The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son.
This is the man.
Did he cry?
Tell him to surrender.
They will steal anything and call it spoils.
And I will give you some more.
Soon enough.
I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this.
The humiliation is all mine.
I’m here, here!
That’s how Claudio will respond.
I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one.
Oh my, Oh my!
You’re mistaken.
So go away.
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
I did kill her.
In suicide, gods make the weak strong.
Do something about it, then.
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo.” Some are crying “Juliet,” and some are crying “Paris.” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb.
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message?
Let’s go offer up our lives 
You don’t love me.
You can speak to me.
I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you.
Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.
Why did I ever have one?
Cheers, boys.
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.
Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play.
Or tell me, my sweet love, what you’d like to eat.
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
Go ahead, you fool.
Leave us.
On top of this, they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent.
You’re asking me!
Drowned?
Some achieve greatness—” What are you saying?
Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married?
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
And if he ever has a wife, let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now.
Imagine, me, a drunk!
I can’t, my lord.
Why, the he that will marry this woman.
Now be quiet.
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.
Why, wouldn’t you?
Don’t worry, I’ll be there.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Caliban, who now serves me.
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town.
Come on then.
Listen they’re howling.
Why, the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death.
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman, that’s certain, one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare, I happen to know from his maneuvers.
I say it’s the moon that shines so bright.
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.
I’m here, sir.
Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.
What are you doing?
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne.
No, I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail.
He wants to eat the English.
The king my father?!
I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal.
Don’t ask why.
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.
But Antonio’s certainly ruined.
I’m suddenly afraid.
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me.
But did I fall or not?
Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
Has Romeo killed himself?
I do suffer love, because I love you against my will.
Send a message to his brother.
Why do you sound so odd?
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.
Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
Drown yourself?
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife.
Where’s he going?
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.
Where’s the Queen?
Then, to answer every man briefly, wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
But in your daughter’s womb I will bury them.
It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal.
It scares me just to hear you talk about it.
She’s desperate.
Lovers, moan and weep.
No, indeed, my lord.
I hope to make the sender blush for it.
Damn my suspicious thoughts!
I never saw my father in my life.
Drink up.
And what is that music?
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding.
I’ve already slept, my lord.
I won’t fail.
How?
Why are you so strong and good?
Here comes Oberon.
You seasoned his food with screams.
Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it.
If we’re  Hello, Monsieur Le Beau.
If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.
No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.
My new master is expecting your approach.
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.
All this is comforting news.
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious.
Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France.
Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist.
I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music.
What friend?
He’s without equal!
God help Claudio!
I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.
Say no more.
Is it true, is it true?
It’s true!
Is that the man you want?
That’s terrible!
Speak, man, what’s the matter?
You’ve served me faithfully.
Be quiet!  
You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.
Show him in.
I don’t really understand what you mean.
I’ll watch this play.
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now.
I’ll never see the likes of him again.
Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?
Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one.
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
Yes, it is.
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
May a plague strike both your houses.
Yes, yes, my lord.
With a needle and thread.
I want my bond.
Calm down.
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
So could I.
Yes, sir.
We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you.
And there’s nothing I can do about it.
Your fortunes are the same.
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues.
Can you help me?
We’re near his room now.
But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?
Do it.
We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy.
I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank you.
I don’t know how.
Very wise.
Richard is looking cheerful today.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?
Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground.
Please put that log down and rest a while.
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!
Yes, I remember.
As I sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck, I heard the music creep over the wild waves, calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies.
Oh, wait, sir.
Think of your sins.
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways.
CASSIO  She’s awake, sir.
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Your ear is good.
Please!
Yes, and she was mild too.
Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
A nice stool.
But sir, he’s crazy.
I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year.
He was a great human being.
I’d be very grateful to you if you did.
The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea.
Didn’t you just say he was?
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself.
Villain, you don’t know the laws of God or of man.
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
Then get to work, poison!
Now, Balthazar, you’ve always been honest and faithful to me, and I trust you still are. 
Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt.
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow.
It’s a very sad day.
I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.
How clever of you.
Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep!
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.
What performances have been prepared?
It has caused the downfall of many kings.
Well, to wear out their shoes and get myself more work.
Me too.
Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year.
The privilege of never seeing me again.
So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”  
Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head.
Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves.
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
You call this sneering?
I want to learn how to lie.
Caesar, beware of Brutus.
You’re a cobbler, are you?
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
You’re right—I’ll go quietly.
Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. 
God, help us not be jealous!
Here comes Kent.
Come over here, nurse.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me.
From what, in God’s name?
Be thrifty.
Tongue, do not speak.
Have mercy, Jesus!—Wait, I was only dreaming.
Are you crazy?
I had business that made me late.
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Go then, slave.
Is Signior Lucentio at home, sir?
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
Not much.
Aren’t they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships?
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind.
These are unnatural events.
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.
The Lord Mayor is knocking.
Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace.
So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone.
I think you’re denying what you really are.
Help me out of here, quickly!
They killed my children too?
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond, and Buckingham, backed by a hardy Welsh army, is on the march.
Now that I’m done, Wall can go away.
But not the woman who scolds, anyway, I hope.
Lady Beatrice is angry with you.
You gave money to me?
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs.
Yes, I really think so.
Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you?
What’s the message from the English king?
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here.
Yes, yes.
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man?
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.
Why is the Jew waiting?
Pish!
He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise, though he puts on this show of stupidity.
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.
Why is that?
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried.
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony.
Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive.
When should the royal day be?
My husband will save me.
I’ll have no halves.
Were these things we’re talking about really here?
I could find it in my heart to beat him— Come on, kiss my feet.
Dear Sir Toby, don’t do anything rash tonight.
Beautifully, sir, beautifully!
I beg you not to do this, my lord.
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
Please come with me.
And I was just going to yours.
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
That’s not in her favor.
Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.
The most beautiful queen they ever had.
He’s serious.
Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend.
Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are?
I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
Let me be captured.
Revenge!
Here comes another group looking for you.
If you do that, I’ll never respect you again.
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
How exactly have I offended you?
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad!
Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.
But here she comes.
He’s a fool and a spendthrift.
Enough.
It’s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey, thinking to spend the night here.
And I’m expecting his reproach.
Caius Ligarius, I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin.
The king won’t live, I hope.
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!
One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands.
The name suits your fierceness.
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately.
Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen.
Brother, I’m giving you good advice.
Why do you spit at me?
I will settle this matter. 
What, you don’t want me to be chaste?
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.
Really, I had no intention of going for my sword.
Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?
Then you are damned.
I just did my duty, sir.
I’ll give him some liquor.
I, sir, am Dromio.
What’s this?
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
She’s the one who’s got to do it.
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.
Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating.
Don’t cry, don’t cry.
What should I pay you?
I’m going now.
She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then.
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive.
Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?
Here, sir!
I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly.
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Say it again—just one word, and my hand, which killed your lover out of love, will kill your far truer lover.
Today I’m going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward’s children or his wife’s allies.
I wish you’d do what I ask!
Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself?
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
You’re poisoning my eyes.
God, I’m crazy about her.
Come on, sweet Audrey.
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
You armor my heart.
They’re entirely welcome.
Yes, his chest!
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him.
He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter.
Hang him immediately.
Well, you’re a liar, then.
Please.
Is he all right?
And Cassius too.
But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother, young George.
I don’t want to hear you sing.
Where are those bastards?
If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion.
There, take my fool’s cap.
Apologize?
Ran off with a Christian!
Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.
Good night, honest Iago.
The moment they planned to act is almost here.
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!
Tell me, how is my mother?
What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
Thrice noble lord, I beg you to excuse me for another night or two—or at least until nightfall.
Unleash the dogs in the western valley.
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome.
According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger.
When will we get to the top of that cliff?
How can I help you?
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
Follow him, friends.
Well, Oswald?
Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.
I’m hanging on every word.
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.  
Look out, he’s coming!
My door is locked.
In the end I grudgingly consented.
My belongings are on the ship already.
Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?
This must be some kind of fairyland.
I’d rather bear with you than  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
We’ll meet Macbeth there.
Come and get it!
They’re just flattering me.
Do you think you’ve won?
I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore.
Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Take away this fool, gentlemen.
But despite all this, your daughters will give you a lot of money—or do I mean pain?—in the coming year.
No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!
Please, my lord, call her back.
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters?
She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit.
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you.
Will they see us?
Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.
Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow!
Whatever I think, I have to say.
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive.
She could even what?
Oh life!
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king.
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
Tell us what you know about this affair.
Make sure everyone knows that.
Where is he?
I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair.
The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people.
What is the name of the castle that stands over there?
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.
That’s not a job for a friend, my lord.
It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love.
I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl.
Grumio, get me my horse.
Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish.
I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl.
And to me, Denmark is a prison.
So you want to put a man in your belly.
But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words.
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.
I’ll tell him right away, my lord.
I’ll do it with all my heart.
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew?
Time, you thwart my dreadful plans.
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?
That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death.
This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
Servant monster”?
Set it down.
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
As dumb as dirt!
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you, Antony, were Caesar’s son, you would be satisfied with them.
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife.
God defend and guard us innocents against them!
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm.
The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light.
Good, I’m satisfied.
That’s one of them.  
Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?
Three times in an hour I saw him down, and three times up again and fighting.
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
I won’t have one any bigger.
Either the lovers have different social standings—
What do you mean by that?
I have to tell you everything.
Performing is activity, and he is always doing that.
Am I sorry that I only had one child?
The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree. 
Where is he?
Come here, Sir Andrew.
You have broken my heart.
I mean, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful?
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard.
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me.
And why did you come?
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim?
Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.
If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe even hate you.
Good night to you both.
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
I’ll do it, if you help me out.
If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.
What else you do know?
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.
Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!
Welcome to Cyprus.
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man.
Tell them this, Publius.
Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?
Yes, sir.
Does Leonato have a son, my lord?
Oh!
Is it a beggar?
What’s this?
What, like stuff from a house?
My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music.
You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit.
I’ll steal away to England, and I’ll steal some more when I get there.
Murder!
If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.
He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice.
Where is that knocking coming from?
I’ll go my own way.
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool.
If only all struggles ended this well.
Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head.
Ha, ha!
But where will I lie tomorrow?
We answered them, blow for blow.
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.
Have a nice day!
Yes, she did tell us.
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia?
Be on guard duty tonight.
Let us die honorably.
I know my medicine will work on him.
Did you see anything?
Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink!
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?
Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
The Venetians are waiting for their food.
Ah, revenge!
It doesn’t matter how I am: he hurt me, and that’s that.
What traitor hears me and doesn’t say amen?
Ha!
God will revenge it.
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?
I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract.
Absolutely.
My master said it.
And now he’s gone.
You’re not paying attention to me.
We’re in.
Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s.
If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.
Who’s that?
My lord, your promise of the earldom— Richmond!
Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about.
No.
Who is that gentleman?
Good night.
I will live in your heart, die in your lap, and be buried in your eyes—and, what’s more, I will go with you to your uncle’s.
Goodbye.
Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain.
I would’ve given it to you this morning, but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel, so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late.
I hear their drums.
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me.
Where?
A friend would never see those faults.
What prisoners of rank have been taken, uncle?
Yes, indeed they are.
God protect you from them and from other false friends!
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
Hello, mortal!
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.
I’ve heard her say that.
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.
My dear sir!
He acts like a man in love.
We respected the beat of the song, sir.
I wish my eyes were 
Oh, heavenly mixture!
He was the one who denounced his father.
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
So you don’t love me?
Farewell, sir.
Here’s to Caesar.
I’m not one of his sluts.
I hope you’ll be a good father to me now.
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
Please, somebody, get us out of here!
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.
Happy with Hermia?
Honestly, no.
From now until then seems like twenty years.
If you’re going to die, be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him, like obedient subjects, to his new kingdom of endless night.
I think I can do that.
I tell you, I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream.
I have to obey. 
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves.
I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.
No.
She’s full of good intentions.
Don’t spend any more time here.
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them?
I know that she is worthy of that love.
Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars.
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow.
Well, what was your dream?
Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
I’m not as happy as I seem.
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears.
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.
Adieu, good Mr. Depression.
Who are all these people?
Do you want to hear what she says?
That’s the one, sir.
I didn’t say free, madam.
What did he say?
I’ve brought him a present.
We must not.
Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?
What a heavy sigh!
I told you, someone’s at the gate.
Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.
No.
And just try to remember a few rules of life.
What a poor, gullible monster.—That was a nice big gulp, monster!
The biggest clue is his seriousness.
Sweetheart!
Come talk to me about this.
My lord, I don’t think I cried out.
The same to you, my lord!
I hope some will fall off tomorrow.
Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius?
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators, justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man almost to death.
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent?
Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir.
For what?
It is an honor that I do not dream of.
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
Losers always leave quickly.
I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.
Well, that turned out well in the end.
Because of me?
How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?
Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock.
When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath.
Put your straw hats on, have some fun, and dance with these young nymphs.
That’s why I’m worried about you.
Do so, good Messala.
But wait a minute.
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.
I’ll rest here.
Sir, be a man.
Look at them.
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.
The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
You expect me to cry?
Well, but what time is it?
Where’s Cesario going?
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
I will.
You’ll be afraid to hear it.
No, you’re just taunting me.
I’d risk my soul for that.
Oh my!
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
Yours, if we’re talking about  I’m leaving.
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
Now let me see if I can translate it.
Please, sir, be quiet.
I know, prince.
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.
These revelations have overwhelmed her.
Actors can’t keep a secret.
I’m not here.
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion.
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.
I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
If I’m a wasp, look out for my stinger.
Hurry up.
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story.
I’ll talk to you more about this some other time.
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood.
What brings him here?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
We’re following you not only because it is our duty, but also because we want to.
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
What?
I’ll cross myself.
God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head.
Stand up if you’re really a man.
The door is open, sir.
Ha!
And I departed in a rage, right?
Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!
Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.
Enough!
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.
I know that young men look forward to their rest.
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.
Run, run, oh, run!
Come on, take control of your feelings.
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him.
There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that.
I’ll follow it.
Do you have what I told you to get?
The storm has begun and everything is at stake.
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.
Look, he can become invisible.
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you.
First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of.
with the same accessories.
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
What’s the matter with you now?
Let those who will hear me speak stay.
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester.
My lord, I’ll do it right away.
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.
By running fast.
They have to stay there.
Aren’t I your Rosalind?
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.
I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me.
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company.
Gloucester, it’s true that we are in great danger.
May God bring you sleep!
I look forward to getting to know you better.
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
Look, here he comes.
Please, let me go.
May I speak, Caesar.
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
More, please, more.
He’ll stay as long as I say.
So you’ve dared him to single combat.
But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
My lord of Gloucester, I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long.
Show me.
Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which.
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster.
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.— Yes, so he says.
Very suspicious.
Pray, let me stay.
Are you considering desertion, as well?
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack?
What is it, Agrippa?
That part is up to you.
Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.
Informed them”?
Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, “Have arrest.” Well, sir, stop your joking there.
Take me to him.
You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself.
Has your heart cooled toward me?
That’s him.
Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice.
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
Let’s get out of here.
Oh, did he?
For shame!
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me.
I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.
I have sent for the strawberries.
Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors.
Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say— Shush, please.
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” You explained it all.
Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Stop, sir, for God’s sake!
You are my love, my love, I think.
I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells.
Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank.
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it.
Where’s Dolabella?
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up.
I never saw a better-designed gown, more elegant and pleasing and well made.
The fire is ready.
Shall I accompany your Grace?
They’re just fine, my dear madam.
That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.
The things men are allowed to do!
No, you have to swear it.
Is it now afternoon?
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
In Rome, Madam.
Listen, listen!
Where is he?
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
In fact, the real nightmare had only just begun.
Please, marry us.
I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!
I won’t be kind to you.
Oh, oh, oh!
Why?
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
I’m forty-eight.
Who are you?
Many times, madam.
No money, I swear.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
True, if a fool such as yourself could find it.
If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees.
This lantern represents the moon.
Don’t kneel, noble Portia.  
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
I hope I see him and hear him again soon.
Oh no, my reasons are deep and as permanent as death.
I’ll torment them all till they roar with pain.
It’s not okay!
I tell you, man, it’s better for me, too, than the last time we met here.
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold.
I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar.
You didn’t do anything else to earn this punishment?
Do so.
Don’t believe in this.
Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while.
When he couldn’t what?
And you, go call my fool.
On Thursday, sir?
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other, in the ordinary and equal clash of battle?
He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns.
You’re lying.
Yes, my lord.
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
Somebody’s knocking.
Well, there you go.
But how?
Honestly, sir, I’d need to use words to explain why, and since words are so unreliable and false, I’d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion.
Well, sir, it’s better to say little than to be tedious.
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse.
No.
What’s she doing now?
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.
He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy.
I have bankrupted three tailors.
If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger.
Goodbye, boy.
That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully.
So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure.
You speak well.
Wear both the ring and my heart, because both are yours.
We thought you ought to know about it.
Knock, knock!
Because who is this man they follow?
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome.
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king.
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
If you refuse it, the whole country will regret it.
Be patient with him, Brutus.
I did that to him.
Is supper ready?
Thieves!
That’s what her mother always tells me.
The owl made noise all night.
Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.
Welcome, Publius.
When?
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.
No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure.
Oh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.
Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything.
Yes, my lord.
Eat and sleep.
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.
Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food.
Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you.
This is the prophecy that the wizard 
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.
I want my sword.
But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy.
Go on.
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus?
He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more.
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
Take this, too.
I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!
Open your gates.
Yes, yes.
Thank you, sir.
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
Cassio, my lord?
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise.
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
On me, though I am limping and deformed?
I obey all your thoughts.
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John.
Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
Is it daytime?
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
Peter!
There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people.
He’ll recover his sanity there.
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord.
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
The poor thing!
Oh no, good Cassio!
Who’s there?
I knew you’d turn out this way.
But who cares.
Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?
Go, take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can.
The tyrant I’m serving now can go to hell!
You are your father’s daughter.
The duke’s trumpets.
Has anyone seen Cesario?
Are the others waiting?
But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts.
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.
Ha!
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
You didn’t go to sleep, then?
The sky frowns and scowls on our army.
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
What news do you bring?
C’mon, make an effort.
Do you like pictures?
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover, and now that she’s getting married to Theseus, you’ve come to celebrate their marriage.
Yes, that’s me.
First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty.
Why did this have to happen now?
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense.
Are you this impatient?
Tell me, Fluellen: did you just come from the bridge?
Are you going to Scone?
I’m not marvelous, sir, but I’m certainly a maiden.
Take care.
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.  
Oh, I’m sick, sick!
Yes, my lord.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.
My freedom.
Oh, you mighty gods! 
He’s a good man.
Oh, look!
Forget your epilogue.
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
Beat—
Please don’t say no.
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform.
Go on, my loving lord.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
So, are you done?
Thank you, sir.
Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me.
If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him.
I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
To kill the boys with the luggage!
You thought you were being funny, but you said the truth.
A fair woman!
We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed.
Yes, that’s why you have to die.
Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
These are nothing but jealous lies.
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste.
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times.
You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
Oh, so cruel!
How many months do you want?
Do as I say.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile.
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle.
So stay for a while.
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up.
My letters are ready to go.
I’m in a rush.
I hear his footsteps.
Give me my armor.
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
Can’t what, my lord?
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.
You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away.
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants.
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens.
Is Fleance going with you?
How can that be?
Here’s mine.
Why don’t you go away for a bit?
How dare I?
His nurse?
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
But let it rain; I’ll survive.
Now you’re Romeo.
Pick up the corpses.
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast.
I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from.
Hurry, you slave!
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
How are you, my ladies?
He’s written you a letter.
As far as I know, sir.
Tell me anything you remember.
Who’s that?
With crisscrossed laces?
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
You think my uncle was lying, grandmother?
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.
You’re a funny man, sir.
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest.
She cursed Hastings then.
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows.
Pardon me?
The  Get out of here!
What is it, sir?
Here she comes, the brilliant fool-catcher.
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
Don’t miss our feast.
Yes, I do.
Besides, she treats me more respectfully than the other servants.
She was filthy!
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.
Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled.
You lie.
A good name.
I’ll sleep here until morning.
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
I haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love.
With all my heart.
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.
Go back to my sister’s.
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve, saying, “Tomorrow is 
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.
Why did you do that?
If they do fight, I hope Lysander is safe!
Richard.
Would I ever deny you anything?
Your life has had honor in it.
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
This is what happens when you act rashly.
Get away from here and leave me.
Good night, Pompey. 
Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first?
It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of Naples.
That man always looks so sour!
Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier.
He’ll come right away.
A worthy fool!
How did this happen?
She shall be buried next to her Antony.
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.
The muffled queen”?
Look, and you’ll see.  
When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
Macbeth!
Why, she was dead before you were even born.
I’m the one, Hamlet.
Scum!
Then it’s confirmed!
Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty.
Here comes Sir Oliver.
Well, Susan died and is with God.
Anything.
Who, me?
It’s nothing, my lord.
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.
Welcome, my good friends.
If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
Spread the word.
Go to bed right this minute.
Lock the doors, my lord.
Where is he staying?
Wait, here’s a coin for you.
Yes!
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
I hope you think I’m faithful to you.
I have forgotten your name, but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.
I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.
Answer all of us, now.
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order, who came after Clarence was already buried.
This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
I speak to you as a plain soldier.
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture.
No, to the Whitefriars monastery.
You’ll find us both at Crosby Place.
No.
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
Who’s calling me?
That will be a good thing.
I have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest.
His military ability is double that of the other two.
And I for Rosalind.
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool?
If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up.
Come on!
You know what they say.
Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that?
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
You all know this cloak.
If he backs down, he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth, in my opinion.
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
It’s not daylight.
Quiet!
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?
Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
I’ll read you a sermon.
Nothing else, for God’s sake!
So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.
My noble brother!
Farewell, sir.
When she cries, all the little flowers cry too.
Come on, sir.
Go find him.
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.
But let her live.
There’s more to this ring than its cash value.
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.
I hear it now overhead.
It’s called the evil.
She has royal blood.
Have some patience, please.
You have to contradict me, do you?
Go walk the path that you will never return from.
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady.
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.
What do you say now?
What time is it?
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought?
Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles.
Please, hurry up.
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?
Master, is this Satan’s mistress?
Is that what you’ve heard?
What do you think that means?
Give us answers.
Give me the goblets.
Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?
If any legs here are Trinculo’s, these are. 
I could do it myself.
When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage.
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
Didn’t they ever whisper?
But if she can’t love you, sir?
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.
If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.
Is he crazy with love for you?
Lucius, wake up!
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.
Would I dare do something like that?
Be silent, or else my magic spell will be broken.
Yes, God be praised, I have managed to earn his favor.
Is it possible?
Here comes a messenger.
Keep an eye on her.
Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.
I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.
Ah, the countess is coming!
Retreat!
He says his name’s Poor Tom.
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today.
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.
I’m going on alone.
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war.
Why do you look like that?
Oh, has it come to this?
I don’t like sports.
Oh, my, it’s my husband.
Yes, we will.
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
Good-bye.
That villain, Romeo.
Who’s next?  
When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age.
Your eyes are playing tricks on you.
What’s she trying to say?
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.
My husband?
Where are you from?
I wish you’d won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale.
And now, let’s turn to our business with the French.
Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing.
What are you going to do?
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.
Oh, you streetwalker!
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it.
It is, it is.
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
How dare you talk about kindness or shame.
What was I saying?
I have no desire to go outside, yet something leads me there.
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.
Accept it in body and spirit.
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.
Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.
Maybe?
Will you come immediately?
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here?
What’s this all about?
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.
God forbid he wants to challenge me!
Excuse me?
Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man.
Forgive me, darling Rosalind.
Come over here.
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak.
Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.
A mischievous child.
I don’t feel anything.
Stop eating?
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money.
You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter.
Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits?
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.
Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely!
A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases.
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.
Murder, murder!
Don’t misunderstand me, sir.
So be it, Dolabella.
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon.
Thank you.
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you, You’ll have a fool’s head forever.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.
Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters.
Do you have unusual snakes there?
How would you woo her?
I mean well, sir.
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
I meant to say the Lord Protector.
I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can.
True, he has an excellent reputation.
Do you even get what I’m saying?
This treachery of yours is like the second 
He’s at home, my lord.
Let them go.
By all means.
Let this anger sharpen your sword.
Travelers have never told lies, no matter what the fools at home accuse them of.
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
Which of you two ate lunch with me today?
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.
No, sit down.
Have you completely forgotten?
He hasn’t told this to the king, has he?
You haven’t been conquered.
Take this garment, put it on, and then come back here.
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop, and eat no more.
At least it’s possible in Denmark. 
Come, tailor, show it to us.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
With a touch of green in it.
Now two things still need to be done.
Well, whose is it?
No, I’ll help too.
And he did.
What do you remember?
Let’s hear it.
I beg you to let me go.
Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning.
In short, I’m not.
I’d like to sing my song solo.
Yes, my lady.
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.
Very good, sir.
Come on.
Tell the constable that.
So what if I killed her husband and her father?
Whenever you want, since you’re the one who wants it.
I remember.
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear.
Didn’t you know?
Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.
Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength; the opposition doesn’t have that advantage.
creet.
Go with my brothers to my English peers.
The priest is already there.
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
What has Caesar done to deserve your love?
That was one hit.
It was incredible!
You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult.
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy.
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
Yes, she saw me quite clearly.
I’ll head to France soon.
Like hell she is!
I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world.
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song.  
Don’t believe any of us.
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
You’ll live in luxury with Gremio.
I hear some noise.
He’ll be a good governor.
It’s a long story—and tough to listen to.
Did you see him?
My dear Gloucester!
Please, will you take his arm?
Wash your hands.
I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband.
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush.
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
I remember.
And a bad singer, my lord.
Officer, I’ll take the responsibility from you, and the blame too.
The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
When you avoid one trap, you fall into another.
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.
I’ll get you for that.
You’re so much older than you look!
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Your hand is  Well, I hope so.
There was no harm, I’m telling you.
We thank your Honor.
I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
He did, my lord.
What a horrible world we live in!
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone.
Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.
And then?
Fine.
Good morning to you.
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.
Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine.
So use your discretion.
I’m not going to bed tonight.
In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
Words before fighting.
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
Good girl, give it to me.
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.
Our guiding light is out.
I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise.
Now please listen, sir.
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother.
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey?
That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire.
We have two hours to get ready.
He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.
But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery.
No, I had to do something.
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.
Don’t deceive me.
Let’s go.
He is.
Yes, my lord.
Who did this, Sir Andrew?
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy, I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence.
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
But he isn’t here now.
Sir, he may still be alive.
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you.
My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— I know what you’re about to say.
But what am I afraid of?
Write to me very soon and I’ll let you know what she thinks.
I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.
Come, and you can have a queen.
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
Watch out!
You’re a lover.
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs.
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.
He said he did—I don’t know.
Call them.
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why?
I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!
Our leader is being led.
I shall, King Harry.
You’re smiling?
Where’s the evidence against me?
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.
How is my wife?
On this hill and in despair, with his slave Pindarus.
Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
For her I’ll be strange and condescending, and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away.
That’s for sure.
What’s this?
This is Antonio, my dearest friend.
I’m coming, my lord.
Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight.
Sir, he’s with Caesar.
You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home.
Hold on, then.
This is a good agreement.
I will, sir.
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
Yes, my lord.
It’s a nice hand, an open one.
Look, here are the boxes, prince.
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.
I said she was.
Let’s go.
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love?
I’ll go and coach them.
But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.
Like that.  
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
Gentlemen, we won’t stay here and anger you further.
She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.
No, really, I don’t.
Educated men are so impressive!
What have you got on your head?
So, goodbye.
The law’s on my side.
He seems cheerful.
Will it?
No, not too upset.
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
Who’s that?
No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.
I saw you at Count Orsino’s recently.
Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust.
And be a happy mother by doing so.
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience?
I forgot about the reward.
By God, I’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been.
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.
Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that— What do you mean by that?
It’s your turn now.
Come on.
I’m arresting you as a criminal.
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
How long have you believed in astrology?
The brilliant Sir Topas!
And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out.
We’re sorry to hear this.
If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered.
I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage.
A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that.
I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me.
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?
Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!
Have I accomplished so much in battle, but now I’m afraid to tell some old men the truth?
The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—it looked like reeds, not hair—was the first person to jump, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!” Good job!
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
Do it now.
Play, trumpets!
Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.
I’m going to take it from you now.
Dress me up in motley.
So do you take her or leave her?
If his cause is wrong, our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it.
She can’t hurt you, Helena.
Yes, my good lord.
What’s this, my lord?
Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.
My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me.
Please stop turning me around.
Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?
I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard.
No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side.
And in public too.
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it.
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down?
One face, one voice, one way of dressing, but two people!
We want Antony taken alive.
Iago, who started it?
Greed has been the downfall of many kings.
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.
Be loud and obnoxious.
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely, but I won’t stay in any case.
It’s almost fairy time.
You haven’t lost it unless you think you have.
He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.
Sweet men, come to him.
And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.
Where is she?
Yes, my lord.
He’s waiting outside.
He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters.
The drink, the drink!
No, my noble lord.
Why, sweetheart?
I know him.
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood.
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind, and when they fall, they shatter into pieces.
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?
Do you carry a pike?
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
Still the same old Cassius!
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.
Of what 
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.
You seem like a good judge.
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?
I’m going, I’m going.
I want to use this money to set my father free.
The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
There’s no one else here.
Once again, what’s the news?
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
Lucius, who’s that knocking?
Do you make your living by playing that drum?
Hey, Grumio!
So get ready to cut off the flesh.
I have it on me here.
Is that possible?
No, don’t press up against me.
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God.
Ha, ha, ha!
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.
There’s no room for the old man and his followers.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?
Barnardo’s taken my place.
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
Good madam, be patient.
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight.
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away.
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.
He was happy here, listening to a song.
Think about it.
Let me help you up.
Lysander and I are running away from here.
Why did he do that?
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking.
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
Yes, but they don’t see anything.
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come, and, on her knee, she begged me to stay home today.
Day has broken.
Oh, the things men dare to do!
Can’t you wait for a moment?
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.
Live, Brutus!
Tortured, 
Where is he?
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
I admit the cape.
They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
which any peace-lover can do.
How green!
Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you.
Tell her that the king, who has the power to command people, asks her.
How wonderful my master is!
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well.
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all.
Just ignore him.
If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.
As far as I know, he’s not even dead.
I accept your devotion with my deepest love.
My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.
I eat the air, like chameleons do.
Good night, good night.
We’re off, Biondello.
First let’s go to dinner.
Roderigo!
How are you?
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.
Where is Malvolio?
To bed, to bed!
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city?
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.
Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.
What would you like, sir?
Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
Were you thinking of spending the night here?
You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats.
And I am your Rosalind.  
Here.
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool!
Yes, sir.
To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.
If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this.
He’s killed his wife!
A worthy fool!
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.
I swear, you speak the truth.
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.
It’s coming toward me.
How late is it, lords?
Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people?
Fifteen years!
How’s my nephew doing, noble lord of York?
That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy.
Oh friendly friar!
If you can love me for this, take me.
And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before.
People say he’s generous, well educated, and brave, and he’s very attractive.
I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him.
But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.
If not, then I have no powers of observation.
What strange reason could she have for coming here?
You sent me to the port to find a ship.
All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it.
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak.
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio.
Call him in.
Write all this
The moon?
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other?
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.
He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness.
Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.
It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.
No more of these thoughts.
You’ve said it well.
Aren’t things going well?
That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.
There are women like that out there, no question.
Why did you leave the dining room?
Do you love me?
Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully.
Is your name Shylock?
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow.
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
What, aren’t you a Christian?
I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have.
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
Good idea.
We have God and a good cause on our side.
Here is a friar who’s trembling, sighing and weeping.
Well, sir, and you, witty lady, who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk, my name is Vincentio, my hometown Pisa, and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while.
I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir.
Will you kill him then?
This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
Eros, send his treasure to him.
Leave, you little man.
Listen to me, you traitor.
Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people.
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer, noble father-in-law.
I’ll hound him.
How did her eyes get so bright?
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?
Come, let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans.
God forbid!
So be cheerful.
Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field.
I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die.
Oh, now I really need that priest who spoke to me today!
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth.
Please, sir, be patient.
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens.
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
He will live as a cursed man.
Portia, what are you doing awake?
I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
I’ll go get them, sir.  
I’ll talk with this good man.
Honest Iago’s arranged that.
I hope not.
I don’t want to play now.
So please rest.
What do you mean, my lord?
You know tomorrow is her wedding day.
If there’s anyone in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his.
Yes, my lord.
I don’t want to go mad.
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.
My husband!
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers.
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.
My dear friends, thanks for your patience.
No, it heals gradually.
Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers.
I know you’re the right person for this job.
I have my naked sword out.
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
Don’t swear at all.
You’re making a terrible racket out here!
Whip him!
His speech was like a tangled chain.
I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you.
I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you.
And your lies caused this murder.
I’m warning you.
Do so.
I can hear the lark singing.
We have to give up and let him go.      
Goodbye, Edmund.
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand there in my spell.—
As a wandering lunatic, he can do whatever he wants.
Don’t follow me.
Is there any news about my husband?
I really don’t know.
Good afternoon, good gentleman.
Be careful not to fall in.
They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands.
What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust?
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break.
Where are you, keeper?
I think I saw you there, you wise man.
Did you hit your head?
Why?
Oh, he’s really gone.
Quiet!
What time is it?
What, you look amused.
But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me.
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name.
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.
It’s obvious.
Bring us the letters.
But listen to me, signor—
Hello, sweet lady.
The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius.
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
What is that bloody knife?
Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?
If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke.
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.
I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons.
God bless you, sir.
But you’re wrong.
Let’s go, Menas.
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
But I’ll punish them thoroughly.
If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio!
Oh, ceremony, only show me your value!
Why, what’s the matter with him?
God save your Majesty.
They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
Run to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude.
Oh, here she comes.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
It’s a big deal to you.
Death is the best way to cover over her shame.
What time is it?
If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.
All my pretty little children?
The more I try to hide what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets.
But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward.
Here, here, sir!
Arrest him: he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s.
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
No.
We shouldn’t displease him.
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.
So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.
Oh, that’s very nice!
It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up.
There’s a feud between the two dukes.
Please, pay him immediately.
What’s her skin like?
I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me.
He’s married, madam.
So be it.
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable?
A better example—come on.
He’s a devil, a born devil, who can never be trained.
Is this really happening?
I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?
I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop.
I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your daughter?
I’ll rest now.
Soon all my work will be done, and you’ll be free.
But will my Rosalind do this, too?
You are building your nest in 
My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s time, it’s time!” Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails.
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
You dog, you peasant!
Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman?
That’s good.
Well, then, that’s how it is.
No, he comes to be married  Lady, do you come here to be married to this count?
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this!
I really want to sleep now.
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army.
She hangs around me all the time.
Of course.
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol.
We came here to fight against you.
Oh Scotland, Scotland!
Here.
Good God, I was about to say something.
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.
Listen to my excuse.
I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.
First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up.
Let’s hear what Antony has to say.
Trinculo, if you interrupt him any more, I swear I’ll knock some teeth out of your head.
She will not.
But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will.
He mixed that poison himself.
Stay here.
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.
But it doesn’t matter.
That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.
Oh, but there’s one more thing to tell you.
Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!
You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing.
For God’s sake, let me hear it.
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
Oh, how strange!
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.
You can have what you want.
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
Thank you.
They steal hearts.
And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough.
Ha, ha!
Allow me to continue.—I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, who, hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit, her friendly disposition and bashful modesty, her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior, have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true.
Oh, that most wicked fiend!
A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew!
Okay, but when?
What!
Well, it’s not for me to say.
And I’ll be eternally grateful to you.  
Mighty duke, please allow me to say something.
He’s safe, Antony.
Take my hand, Hastings.
Have a good morning.
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
Who are you?
What does a crocodile look like?
For that reason he sends you this good news—that this very day your enemies, the queen’s relatives, will die at Pomfret.
Let me talk to you about your situation.
Who are they following?
When did she send you?
What’s all the noise in here?
There wasn’t any problem.
Me neither.
Like a good doctor.  
No, please, read it like a sane person.
I know what I’m talking about.
But they aren’t.
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill, you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck.
Next thing you know, he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas.” “Widow Dido,” did you say?
Aren’t you dead yet?
How can you test them like that?
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.
Is that how it is, countrymen?
I’ll follow in the center of the troop formation, which I’ll defend with my best horse, and with Saint George on my side, as well!
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth.
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles.
But how did you want it made?
Say goodbye to me.
I don’t know what to say.
They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural.
Absolutely everything.
A devil like you could lead me to hell.
Let thunder rumble!
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
Come out.
So much for Fortinbras.
He’s going senile.
Don’t run away—stay where you are.
It’s after six o'clock, my lord, when you said our work would be finished.
So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day.
Or in the power of reason.
It’s good we’re doing this.
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.
My daughter is still very young.
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless.
Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.
Is he in his royal garments?
Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day.
I’m not.
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.
Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.
Silence, then!
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!
Did you kill him, then?
I mean a husband.
Shylock is my name.
Please, leave it here.
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes.
What’s the matter?
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none.
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.
If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.
That guy’s funny.
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business.
I never saw him like this before.
Good morning, neighbor Baptista.
Keep an eye on her, Moor.
Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this?
Why are you making them work so hard?
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors.
How many people who are humble now would be great then?
That’s enough for one lesson.
Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and shout “So, so!” Each one of your servants will rush here,
Here they come.
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
I’ll go put my armor on.
Then have your servants bring him out.
So, in God’s name, let’s march.
Let’s get started right away.
He is.
The sound is going away.
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs.
Look, here she comes!
I won’t.
Come here, Proculeius.
Wait.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
So get prepared.
And the one who commands us is our king.
Oh, God help me!
We’ll answer.
Hang on a minute—who are you?
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment.
By eight o'clock.
Shall Kate be my wife?
A friend.
But let me try my luck on the boxes.
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.
True.
Whatever seems best to you.
What’s the matter, husband?
You slander her, you devil.
Laugh at the power of other men, because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth.  
Please, dear, come here.
Where have you been hiding?
This choice was as foolish as they are.
Yes, please tell me.
Let me see Philostrate.
Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.
So have a seat and talk to her.
When did you become so fond of singing, boy?
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
Halt.
How does he love me?
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults.
Do you know him?
Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda.
My daughter told me everything.
Age is the thing that nourishes.
I’ll read it aloud.
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.
My love, call him back in here.
Yes, my lord.
I am resolved—to let him live.
Thank you, master.
It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.
Thank you.
Nobody was hurt in the slightest.
Now I’m scared again.
How are you, my friend?
This is all quite pleasant.
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!
It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest.
Because she’s been chosen by Signior Hortensio.
Excuse me, sir?
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.
Why, sir, must he?
Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me.
Nothing.
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.
Look who’s here!
I loved Ophelia.
Give it to me.
Come, warble for me.
I will.
I wish my father could see them with my eyes.
Absolutely, you idiot.
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.
No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred.
Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price.
Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying.
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.
We’ll watch them starve to death first.
It’s too late to go to bed now.
Is the king leaving here today?
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood.
Oh, is that so?
Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy.
Thank you for asking, uncle.
That too.
So you’re admitting Clarence, my father, is dead.
Calm down, gentle cousin.
We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
Look, sir—here it comes!
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil.
Oh Dardanius!
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before?
The criminal is the one who stole the nest.
Pay for something I never got?
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.
If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have.
I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune.
Are you going to start eating worms and flies?
Time ambles for both men.
I’ll get it done right away.
I’ll test it out.
Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head.
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation.
Usually fathers produce children, not the other way around.
Or should we enter without apologizing?
As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form.
Caesar is in a sober mood.
I’m sorry to find you like this.
I know the man a bit.
I say you’re not.
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life, those strong bonds of love?
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the
I’ve got you now, pagan.
Dromio?
No, from the moon, I’m telling you.
Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
But Miranda is so much more beautiful, you can’t even compare the two.
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job.
Take it off and throw it on the ground.
I’ve been up all night.
And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France.
Oh, lying woman!
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.
I’m sorry I said anything.
There must be some mistake, sir.
Oh, Antony!
No more than a minute?
Go ahead.
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
All right then, back home we go.
It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming.
Will you come with me?
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window.
No, I won’t cry any more.
If they see you, they’ll murder you.
I didn’t do anything.
Why are you looking at me so strangely?
Come, Dolabella.
Give my regards to Hastings, Catesby.
And all because I use my own money to make a profit.
With God’s help.
Go away!
No, just help me unpin this.
This madman will murder me.
Who’s that?
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
Why,
I should have known it.
Oh, horror, horror, horror!
Listen to this.
May God reward you for your kindness!
Are you all crazy?
Agree to swear.
Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother.
Unnatural acts will cause  Good night, good doctor.
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does.
I don’t know.
And, being men, the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you.
Did you hear a noise?
Here’s some more news coming in.
Lay off, already!
Oh, noble fool!
It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua.
May the tongues of our critics rot!
Therefore, willingly and yielding.
Too late is more like it.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this.
I’ll vouch for Grumio.
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden.
Just one glass.
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.
Well, you have made a foolish choice.
I’m not Lear.
He’s praying now.
To Baptista Minola’s house.
man’s cheeks.
What did you say, uncle?
Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
He goes forth to war bravely.
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock.
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
Why have you collapsed?
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear.
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says?
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him.
I’m not dead?
Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it.
It’s possible, ma'am.
That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?
Well, aren’t you a good man?
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
Where?
How did you learn about this?
I’d say I was “out of my element,” but that phrase is overused, so I’ll say I’m “out of my air.”
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.
Well, Brutus, you’re noble.
So goodbye, my lady.
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
Yeah, right, go get him.
I hear my father coming.
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead.
What are these warlike noises?
We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers.
Oh, no, good gentleman!
Will you come with me to hear this news, sir?
Yes, yes, Curtis, so hurry up and start the fire.
Am I your servant?
In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments.
So I’d like it copied.
Yes, you did, sir.
Yes, Caesar?
Gallus, you go with him.
Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.
To Dover.
Cheer up, good Adam.
Why are you leading these men through the streets?
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
No, it’s permanent.
But that’s another story.
You understand?
Are you her husband, boy?
Ding, dong, bell.
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
I won’t take it back.
I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today.
We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people.
Your highness will have to force me to tell.
He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him.
Good night.
You got to me first.
I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here.
Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.
She weeps for Edward and so do I, while she does not weep for Clarence, though I do.
Not from crying.
That’s how sound a man you appeared.
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you.
If only his lord were more like him.
Who is this?
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven.
It’s not a false gallop, anyway.
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms.
Let me embrace you.
Please, father, I beg you.
Run off, go visit fairs and festivals!
You’d better shut up!
It’s a bad time for such an injury.
I know you’d never skip school.
But who was that man?
I’m glad to see you.
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Well, he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation.
I didn’t have the heart to say no to him.
You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned.
Your husband knew about everything.
Help me.
Please give me a little credit!
It is.
It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal.
You inhuman dog!
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Oh, unfaithful lover!
Damn it!
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.
Yes, and these.
Where do you live, pretty young man?
You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it.
Do that.
That’s treason!
No, I didn’t say that.
I’ll arrest him.
Now, Baptista, let’s turn to your younger daughter.
Do tell.
Here’s more insanity for us.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other.
What’s that?
No, please, I beg your Majesty.
No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can.
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven.
He’s his homeland’s jewel.
Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam.
Be patient, madam.
And how he loves Caesar!
Oh, Stephano, two men from Naples survived!
BASSANIO Please, Leonardo, think about this  I’ll do my best.
Ask her to help you get back your position.
Oh, how awful!
Swear you won’t.
Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice?
I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea.
What’s that, my lord?
If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too.
I won’t answer that.
I saw him holding the handkerchief!
Portia!
Your statue spouting blood through many holes, in which many smiling Romans bathed, means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood, and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood.
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast.
I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter.
What will be my evidence?
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.
I won’t be gone long.
For the same thing.
Go home to bed, Francisco.
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them?
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go.
That’s worse.
But what if my answer’s no?
Oh, lady, speak again.
Tell me.
Welcome to Elsinore.
And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord?
But how?
The wiser the woman, the wilder.
Won’t you tell me who told you that?
Goodbye, then.
You have the nerve to call me daughter?
Poor Antony!
I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.
Oh, Caesar, read mine first, for my petition affects you more directly.
Beware Macduff.
Thanks for telling me.
This is beyond words and beyond belief!
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind, so you may believe me.
Oh sweet mistress, speak!
But you must not attract iron, because my heart is as true as steel.
Chat her up, Sir Andrew.
Really, I think your other ruff is better.
Where is Lucentio?
But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.
He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly.
Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape.
Oh, come on now, Kate.
What’s going on, Horatio?
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
Really, I’m afraid you are.
If that’s what you want, all right.
Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.
Are you Sebastian?
Whose tongue?
Is he dead?
Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk.
Please, tell me some of them.
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever.
Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth!
Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.
But wait a moment.
There’s always a breath of fresh air here.
If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.
But has Catesby gone?
Let’s see.
Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep.
Yes, making a big fuss.
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear.
Yes, Desdemona.
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.
How are you, Guildenstern?
Good morning, brother Bedford.
Go to her and tell her for me.
I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable.
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
Listen to me, madam.
Set fire!
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Oh, you excellent young man!
See, now I have you.
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.
My name’s Macbeth.
Good.
Brutus, my lord.
You call that ranting?  
Ha!
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Let me talk, good lady.
What, do you think we’re Turks or savages, instead of Christians?
How goes it, friend Eros?
Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife.
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Why is that cauldron sinking?
Is all of this about your father?
I’m watching the play.
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.
So don’t think that I’m drunk.
Go ahead, then.
You refused me both.
It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s worthy of your love.
I’m serious, I can’t.
When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth.
Hurry!
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.
It is that.
I wish I had!
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
Fabian can hardly control him over there.
Yes, I’m sure he’s dead.
Goodbye, Helena.
As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him.
I know the people of Venice well.
Give me your hand.
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Too late, good Diomedes.
Yes, she’s young and tender.
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly, crying for some fish to eat.
What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
Tell me.
Yes, very bad.
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.
You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly.
Well.
Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting?
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again.
You’re    Pull out your tool now.
Isn’t this war against me?
Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice?
Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death.
This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king.
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb.
The other day I saw him defeated in a
You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.
Yes, like that.
Yes, and the best looking too.
If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly.
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon?
Just the weathervane moving.
Then follow me and listen to my speech, friends.
It’ll help us more than hurt us.
Listen, but don’t speak.
Well, you have given me great comfort.
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now.
It’s still warm from the cut.
Let’s play.
Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully.
I’ll help you through this business.
Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober.
Slay!
Is this the madman?
I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep.
We have feelings.
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.
Give me your hand.
Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?
Here’s my key.
Is this true?
Then I salute you with this royal title: long live Richard, England’s worthy king!
It will rain tonight.
Well, do whatever you think best.
Yes, like your horse, who, staggering under your boasts, would trot more easily if some of them dismounted.
My husband.
Tell us how it happened, noble Casca.
Okay, now it starts!
Don’t move, dog.
Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.
Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.
Now go, and hurry back.
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three.
Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon.
Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.
Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt.
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.
We’ll be married tomorrow.
What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.
We cannot fight for love as men can.
That can’t happen.
Yes, very well, sir.
But sir, there is no such house, no such maid, and no such men as you have dreamed up, like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece, a Peter Turph, one “Henry Pimpernell,” and twenty more men of this sort—who never actually existed.
Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.
you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago.
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool, boy?
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.
Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
Is there such a place?
Show.
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
You can be married tomorrow if you want.
I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland.
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
How can Caesar be a tyrant then?
Will you come?
If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
What business is it of yours?—Father, be quiet.
That it was, sir.
If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it.
If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.
Let him think about his own debt.
Is he alone?
I will confess it to all the world.
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.
Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay.
Should we just get down to it?
Nym, what you say is true.
You can see how it is all around.
It doesn’t look that way to me.
It’s a good shilling, I promise you.
I like singing.
It’s time for you to know the whole story.
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice.
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses.
If this is so, be patient, sister.
He’s not your man.
it pleases you, I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime.
I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.
With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.
Isn’t there a guard around?
Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
Say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own.
But wait a minute, please.
Antonio, oh my dear Antonio!
If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself.
They’ve eaten themselves sick.
No, sir, I live by the church.
Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.
Take your seat.
If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference, for—to be honest, though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage—my men are considerably weakened by illness, my numbers reduced, and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen, though when they were in good form, I tell you, herald, I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs.
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.
That’s all he asks for himself.
May the gods bless Antony today!
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.
I’ll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf, so that he’ll meet you on the way.
This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation.
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister.
You’ll know about that later.
A false conclusion.
Orlando?
I’m only trying to keep the peace.
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it.
A reason?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.
Don’t do it, sir.
No, he’s in Florence.
Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved.
You who are beautiful beyond words, calm down and let me explain myself.
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged?
He was crazy to run away.
What’s new, cousin Lodovico?
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.
We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem. 
Come on in, con man.
God help me, I love you!
I second that 
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen!
Father, take pity on him.
Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.
Word is that Richmond is the navy’s admiral.
Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.
Why do you need even one?
That’s me.
He can’t possibly be such a monster— And I’m sure he isn’t.
Why are you making these faces?
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.
No, not a chance.
Oh, why is this so?
I’ll bring you there.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
When devoutly religious men are praying, it’s hard to draw them out of it, because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation.
Shake my hand.
Can’t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick, sneaky lowlifes?
Come with me.
Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care.
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!
And what’s her story?
My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
I wish they had stayed!
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust.
Who deserted this morning?
Monday!
That’s very likely.
But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
I’m not a traitor.
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord.
Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.
If you think about it correctly, Caesar has suffered a great wrong.
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it?
Yes, it is.
I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.
But she must be, Friar.
Find the people whose names are on this list?
Damn you for teaching me your language!
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.
And what is the subject?
Pain, yes indeed.
Another hit.
I’ll come back.
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject.
But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.
It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.
I know him to be valiant.
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers.
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
My master’s a total Jew.
No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled.
I’m not moving an inch, pal.
Where am I going?
Shall I include hell as well?
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?
That’s how things should be—straight and smooth.
I think he will stand strong with us.
Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude.
Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly.
Me neither.
Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.
Meanwhile, their  They’ve said their prayers, and now they wait for death.
Are you biting your thumb at us?
Now, tailor, let’s see what you’ve got.
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
To prison, until you’re called into court.
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then.
Now get out of here!
That’s the truth.
Please, fool, go away.
So, take me, death!
Show me the way.
Everyone.
Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully!
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is.
That’s where hell is, and darkness, and fires and stench!
The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law.
And request that she come here.
From this moment on, I’ll never say another word.
Wait until I read the letter.
Who are you talking to?
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor?
Don’t give it away.
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
What are you thinking?
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
What do you think about it?
Lucius!
Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Kneel then, and wash.
I must leave them and seek some better employment.
Goodbye to you all.
They only feel the shadow of joy.
And how would we go about doing that?
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
May God’s arm strike on our side!
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester, where, if you’d like, we can retreat to.
Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land.
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
I wish I’d been there.
We understand you’re just doing it for us, and we’ll be sure to say so.
I was sent for a rope!
And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you.
Go bring them all here; I give you power over them.
Listen to me, good brother.
I’ve never seen him like this.
Oh, killing that child was the dirtiest, most merciless deed there ever was!
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.
Yes, and Wall too.
What do you want?
You who are so skilled in cursing, stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies.
My stomach’s a little upset.
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize, my horse would be a topic for them all.
You have my friendship.
Let’s move.
I tricked your own eyes.
Dear God, thank you!
Cut off their heads?
Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back.
Sir, sir, calm down.
If you like, you can rest a while in my room.
Good-bye.
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland?
But let’s follow it, and then do our dirty work afterward.
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish.
You will never be able to say the same about me.
It’s almost morning.
And we will raise your wages.
Well, should we hear some music?
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!
Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
Live, live!
Yes.
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.
God forbid!
These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.
Do you see this sweet sight?
No, cousin, I’m crying.
I did not kill your husband.
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.
Cut yourself?
I hope you’re an expert in your field.      
Where is the king?
I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.
And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
He’s trembling in his fit!
What’s going on, Malvolio?
This guy will tell us everything.
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam.
This island contains everything beneficial to life.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
Excellent, very good.
If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
When fools cry, you remain stony.
I’ll tear it up when it’s paid.
Pardon, dear father.
Duke, please go ahead with your state business.
No, no, the bell.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much?
Oh, Cassius, if you could only convince Brutus to join us— Don’t worry.
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.
Deal?
Any news from Genoa?
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber.
Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry?
You say you have news that’s old?
Pull off my beard?
I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do.
How old is she?
This is that time.
Yes, my lord.
Goodbye.
Women are lucky, then.
It’s time to reassess the situation.
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands.
His courage is hidden, and when it is revealed, it will shrink.
Oh, my heart!
Who do you obey here?
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.
Yes, but who is he?
My husband is dead.
Poor Tom will take you there.
Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe.
Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already.
No problem, madam.
What are you  Nothing.
Is it time, my Lord Constable?
Now he’s ready for 
Where did you leave him?
He’s dead.
Edmund is dead, my lord.
There she is.
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth.
What a painful condition responsibility is.
What role did you play?
No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.
I’m your little dog, Demetrius.
I believe I have some choice in the matter, sir.
Yes indeed.
From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage.
Fight it like a man.
Ambition shouldn’t be so soft.
You’re not asleep yet, sir?
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Again, goodbye.
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea.
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
How will you get proof?
If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it.
Please, please tell me!
Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field.
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match.
Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me.
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero, and kill Leonato.
I swear, old fools become like babies again.
Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for.
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him.
This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey.
Shall I be your slave?
Madam, how are you liking this play?
Leave me alone.
Give me my money and let me go.
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.
And its tears are wet.
If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever.
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself.
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning”—please, tell me what you meant by that.
Good idea.
His virtue is not hidden.
We’ve seen the best our age has to offer.
That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses.
It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements?
There, where the torch is burning.
All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said.
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.
I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
What can possibly fix this situation?
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club.
I order you to stop!
I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed.
I played Julius Caesar.
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
You’re a fool.
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with.
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?
But let me hear the letter from your friend.
I feel this pinprick.
Now go and get me some booze.
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff.
No?
Please tell me.
But we haven’t made any preparations.
It is not nighttime now.
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.
I’m yours forever.
Are you always going to be like this?
It’s Brabantio.
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare.
I haven’t eaten today.
We have slashed the snake but not killed it.
You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions.
While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed.
No, madam.
How are you doing?
A constant pain to me!
I think so too.
I’m telling you, this house is dark.

Ah, how pitiful!
I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
Did you plan Cassio’s death with him?
Can I have some?
More than anything else in the world, I love you, value you, and honor you.
Where are your sister and Hortensio’s wife?
No, Cassio wasn’t killed.
It’s a bet.
We’ll have supper in the morning.
No, the legs and thighs.
But if you were married, you’d wield some influence.
Come, death, and welcome!
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
I can’t hide what I am.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
Farewell, lady.
So what’s the story, old boy?
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
The spirit is torturing me.
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
Give me your hand, sir.
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.

My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter.
We

He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar.

That’s the one.

Mistress, you have to go see your father.
Where’s Metellus Cimber?
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
Can I go away while my heart stays here?
He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey.

They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen.
Baptista is a noble gentleman—one to whom my father is not completely unknown—and lovely as his daughter is, she is entitled to any number of suitors—myself among them.
Next time I’ll give you nothing for something.
Let that be enough for you.
He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
Farewell, farewell!
Made it for me?
Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me.
I can’t believe that.
I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want.
Who’s the ruler here?
I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you.
Or are you just teasing?
What, here in the middle of the street?
Is there a murderer here?
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
Have you spoken to him?
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?
What do you want with her, sir?
As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy.
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?

This song’s about my dead father.
Keep your word.
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself.
Tell me what you want.
I’d trust him with everything I own.
What did they do wrong?
Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine.
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood.
You wrong me in every way.
Whoo-hoo!
Don’t harp on that point, madam—it’s past.
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this!
Anything that’s mended is only patched up.
But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!
That might be the case sir, 
My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.
I have to eat my dinner now.
Go ahead—say “Amen.” No more talking.
I don’t know, madam.
Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.
The wound can’t be that bad.
We’re off to eat and whoop it up at your father’s house.
Who, me?
Merciful heaven!
Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now.
I’m not that stupid.
You should pity me for that reason, not hate me.
No, I have a commitment.
My lord!
It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid.
Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
I’ll bite my thumb at them.
My servant!
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.
Why stay when love tells you to go?
Halt!
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unfit for toil and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts?

She speaks daggers, and every word stabs.
I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child.
Let’s be light-hearted.
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.
She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous.
You force me to read the will, then?
If it’s true that you don’t need 
You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them.
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
I don’t know what I’m doing.
Good.
But goodbye.
Nothing that interests me, my good lord.
The will!
Where’s your conscience now?
What’s the matter with you?
I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of.
I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance.
Saddle up my horses.
Show.
Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!
Oh, what a wonderful new world, that has such people in it!
I wish you all the best.
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.
What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do?
I know the king and queen sent for you.

Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world.
We’ll listen to him.
He’s dreaming.
Maybe she’s just pretending.
Indeed, I remember it well.
That’s music to my ears.
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
I never gave him any token of romantic love.
Didn’t you hear their shouts?
Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up.
Come on, tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your English broken.
Cheer up, Antonio!
I remember your eyes quite well.
There are enemies here.
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
I won’t bother you.
Good man, why are you crying?
Let’s go for it.
I don’t know, sir.
If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.
Here, noble lord.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now, my friendly servant, thank you.
Are you over your ridiculous mood?
Are you beautiful?
I wish you well.
I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully.
Whatever I say, or think, or do, you’re continually contradicting it.
Let’s draw our own swords too.
Are you with a Cornish company?
Let go of me!
If they march along unopposed, I will sell my dukedom for a sodden, filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion.
But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone?
Your answer?
Our knocking woke him up.
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.
I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her.
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average.
Nothing that you want to hear, my lord, but nothing so bad that I can’t mention it.
If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?
Come, this way to the rowboat.
Dear man, calm your rage.
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?
It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary.
Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.
I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
Where have I been?
Got it?
Be kind and polite to this gentleman.
Well sir, good night.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us.
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it?
How are you and your master getting along?
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus?
He constantly offends me.
We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer.
But who are you?
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king.
Listen to you!
No.
In its tail.
Seven days and seven nights?
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Don’t stay to answer me—get going.
I do, in fact.
Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband!
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.
My name is Hortensio, sir.
Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that.
Officers, what crime have these men committed?
Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields.
Let’s hear what he has to say.
Take out your sword.
Give me the gown.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
Hamlet, you’re dead.
The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works.
This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Make room!
No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead.
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.
A nice, soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard, cold ground.
You don’t?
Victory is with us.
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are!
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell, Signor Baptista?
I’m going to get my  Please, listen to me.
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.
We’ll let you.
Look here, this is the entrance to his room.
Will you wait awhile?
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth.
Leonato, am I standing here?
Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.
You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.
No, I don’t—except as a friend.
I swear he’s the better dog.
Listen to that Petruchio: she says she’ll see you hanged first.
We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided.
You’re right, Charmian.
How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her?
Oh, go away!
Where are you running so fast?
Only too well.
Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil.
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.
A friend.
And if he advances unopposed, my lord, let us abandon France.
are you going to let them break me out of jail?
This is getting worse and worse!
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match.
You’re right, that’s how it is.
Yes, as kind as snow to a harvest.
If what you say is true, you can do the same to me. 
It’s the truth.
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
Hello, Tubal.
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king.
Are you a god?
Why are you silent?
The king is coming.
I’ll go ahead of you, sir. 
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you.
Excuse me.
I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.
The sight of them is offensive.
Give me those flowers.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
And I think she’s at least thirty.
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding.
But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
Bless you, master.
I am a man again.
Isn’t this Stephano, my drunken butler?
Do you hear that, men?
You’re so attractive when you smile.
Oh, Iras, Charmian!
You stupid fool!
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
You sound out of tune.
Isn’t that strange?
As it dissolves, so shall my life.
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.
All right then, confess and live.
And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.
Give me an almanac.
Which one of them did it?
There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.
Yes, that the king is dead.
How are you, madam?
No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my house, and come back in an hour.
That duke who lives nearby is courting her.
The English are in the field, French lords.
Don’t be afraid of greatness.” That was well written.
Good-bye, son.
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud.
I hope they don’t attack us now.
If you get nasty with me, Pistol, I’ll stab you with my sword, in fair play.
What does that mean, sir?
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.
You’re appealing to a son who hates you.
I met him in the street—he was there with that man.
My lord, how are you feeling?
Please go on.
On record, my gracious lord.
Better late than never—and it’s never too late to change.
I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.

At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass.
Who wishes that?
Yes, probably, because I’m staying for lunch.
I’m Christopher Sly.
What are you thinking?
I could drown the world.
Margaret, run into the sitting room.
I am sick and sullen.
And what did he say?
I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
That only proves how inexperienced you are.
Let me borrow a mirror.
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.
Are you educated?
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire.
Most noble sir, stand up.
And who is that?
Here’s the money you wanted, master.
Taste your legs, sir.
As his body grows uglier with age, his mind rots away as well.
If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.
This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.
Sleep well there on the ground.
All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Become a better
I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof.
You do the same, wherever the crowds are thick.
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me.
Come, come, you’re making fun of me.
How’s the queen?
That’s right, and then after we fixed the moon, we’d go bird-hunting.
When the poor cried, Caesar cried too.
Just looking at you makes me sick.
And what will you do if it returns to you?
You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.
Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love.
I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
Listen to me.
Here is the door, sir.
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”?
I tell you, there are good men born at Monmouth.
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.
Lock the door.
Leave me alone.
After a little while, I’ll beat him too.
This is just what the letter said.
My lord is so heavy!
I don’t want to be cured, boy.
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.
Go in, and don’t cry.
Up.
Let him come forward.
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
This doesn’t look like a wedding.
Good morning, my noble lord.
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief.
We’ll go visit Caliban, my slave who always talks to us so nastily.  
You bastard!
Okay, just do this, noble Catesby: sound out Lord Hastings, but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea, that it hasn’t been firmed up yet.
You’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear?
Both, both, my girl.
Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition.
I’ll be a harsh master to them.
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.
Though this island may appear desolate—  
There’s still a spot here.
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king.
That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault.
No, I am a Welshman.
As clearly as I see you, my lord.
I thank your Highness.
And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife.
Bathe his filthy head with warm, scented water.
Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.
We’re not getting any younger.
They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
Listen, Clitus.
Sit down, Clitus.
Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long.
What kept you from telling him this?
He’ll be done in time.
And now I’ll do it. 
Look, here she comes.
Come on.
No, let’s follow him.
Where are you going?
Here comes his Majesty.
I’m sorry.
Be careful, Signior Baptista, lest you be made the dupe in this business.
She’s talking.
I am bound by oath, so please forgive me.
Rage on, blow!
Goodbye to you both.
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point?
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?
I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch.
You are welcome here, my friends.
We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock.
Please, I beg you, don’t scold me.
It’s cheap and nasty!
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine.
I do indeed, my lord.
It’s lovely to see you.
For standing up for this unpopular king.
I must go in. 
They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him.
He’s slept a long time.
You won’t stand and fight.
That’s an odd thing to say.
And I see a lot of Orlando here.
But, sir, here comes your servant.
In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely.
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.
Quiet, everyone!
Mercutio, be quiet.
By the door.
What, would you have me beg for my food?
Where will the old duke live?
Please remember, love.
Now, my lord, what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won’t go along with our plans?
Me too.
Her reputation is also her own.
Hurry, go up to the roof.
Listen!
I’ll meet you there.
As for me, I’ll leave when I like.
Who should hang them?
Then patiently listen to my impatience.
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it.
I held the sword and he ran on it.
Now what?
Here, madam:     Translate.
We’ve all been duped.
Who are you?
Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man.
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn’t know him.
Swear your love for each other.
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
I wish she’d never let you come.
Is it lost?
He’s a knight.
Okay, bring on the play.
He did, and I gave it to him.
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.
I have to leave right away.
And that’s why he went crazy.
I curse her.
No thanks, my good mother.
Me, a penny?
That is exactly why we wanted you here, your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints.
So confess your sin freely now.
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
The king is getting up.
I will, my lord.
Who’s this?
That’s not your fault!
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.
Any minute.
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
His spirits are listening to me, but I can’t help cursing him anyway.
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.
So calm down.
He mustn’t go to prison.
As you were on land.
He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.
Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head.
Well, I recognize this one  Good God!
That’s him, that villain Romeo.
Where did we leave off?
My gallant girls!
Let me see.
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.
What do you mean?
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off.
I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart.
Hello, Curan.
They are.
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?
It’s someone with a torch!
Oh, I wish you’d never been born!
What things, my lord?
Where is my husband?
Lead’s too crass to hold her.
Just as bad, my lord.
There is no jewel like Rosalind.
A man, like you.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies.
We come to hate that which controls us.
Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care.
Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave.
Curse you for your false appearances!
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
There’s no power in Venice that can change an established decree.
If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it.
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!
Are you going to watch the race?
Ride, ride, Messala.
I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering.
What’s the “seventh cause”?
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
Well, the difference of a horse!
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.  
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Okay, I’m ready.
Pish to you, you mangy dog, you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt.
Sir Toby, madam, your relative.
You heard her say it wasn’t me.
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.
I hear what they say about him for doing that.
You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father.
Well go on home.
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?
We’re ruined!
He’s walking over there, sir.
Yes, I am the one.
Oh bloody Richard!
Let them put fear in your heart.
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Everyone else, march on with me.
She shall not.
Don’t hurt me.
You’re a villain!
Locked in her tomb.
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.
I’ve heard a lot more.
Do you need my help?
Just read it.
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you, this will definitely come to a happy end.
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly.
I’ll go and chat with Paris.
If there is, then heaven help him!
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
Have you told her our decision?
Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions.
She was lying even as she was going down to hell.
It’s expressly against the rules of combat.
Come here, Sir Seacole.
What is it, my lord?
Lovely Katherine, if you will love me well with your French heart, I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English.
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!
I’ll be there shortly.
He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die.
Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son.
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto.
Yeah, and he’s going to tame her.
Be lenient, dearest!
Your brothers?
Ah sir, ah sir.
Goodbye.
Take these too.
Oh, what a long, tedious, exhausting night!
Can she give that away too?
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here.
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death.
This is the perfect place to rehearse.
Come, Romeo.
I hope you get what you desire!
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor.
Cassio’s a handsome man.
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel singing now.
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France.
No, it would be impossible.
So, I won’t.
Your mother.
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners.
As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a factor in your plans.
Thank you, Ariel.
Go ahead and write it down.
Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters.
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
Good lord!
My honorable, reverend master?
What’s the news among the merchants?
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
Just a moment.
When I said that, I told you the truth.
Fool, I say!
Go away.
Let Merriman catch his breath—the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth.
He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him, that’s for sure.
Oh, do not wish one more!
It was yesterday, your highness.
The gown was made just as my master was directed.
Find out where the Jew’s house is.
Who’s taken over the watch for you?
Master Fer!
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.
Out.
I’m determined to be heard by someone.
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt?
Ah well, my Kate.
Go release them, Ariel.
This is Decius Brutus.
I’ll go alone.
But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
Get up, man!
I’m glad you’ve come, father.
One more thing, good gentlemen.
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
Our friends are all waiting for you.
Who’s that?
The rooster has already crowed twice.
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.
I’ll take it over to the pile.
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
You’re mistaken.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement—that God fought for us.
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having.
Have you killed Tybalt?
Isn’t he an honest man?
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.
Ha!
Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
Thank you, madam.
There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have.
Bring me a bigger one.
It was tossed into the window of my room.
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand?   
I’ll come with you.
I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir.
Be kind to her.
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.
I’m very glad about that.
Tell him that the mayor, some citizens, and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good.
They swore that you were sick with love for me.
And now you’ve changed?
I’ve only done my duty.
Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am.
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
May God keep you well, sir.
Yes, my lord.
Please, do me this one favor: find out what I’ve done to offend this knight.
What’s this all about?
Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face?
Caesar.
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm!
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.
That will kill our lovers.
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt.
You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off.
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift?
You are welcome, sir.
And no one eat any onions or garlic.
Tell us about the letters that you got from France.
I wish you’d never met him.
Is that how it is, really?
But I’m still afraid.
Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
Believe me, I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.
We’ll be there.
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated.
Don’t stay here, go away.
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor.
What is this?
Be good enough to hear me out.
Where are you hiding?
He had no patience.
Take some men and horses and go to her.
Where is he?
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
Catesby, fly to the duke.
Let’s go!
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.
But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either.
Answer me that first.
I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar.
Why, he told me so himself, and he said he didn’t care who knew it.
Well then, Margaret, Ursula, and my cousin have been very much deceived, for they swore you did.
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
I wish your loyalty were as foolish.
Oh, Mother Nature, why did you create lions?
Your sister’s sister.
Not so fast.
Don’t get wound up, my good man.
My voice is ragged.
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
The law has another hold on you.
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you, and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me.
He rode that prologue like a wild horse.
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
Father is on the lookout.
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.
Why would they do that, my lord?
Wait for mine, sweet soul.
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too.
O, everlasting shame!
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich.
Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
And that’s all there is to it.
They made more money and got more attention in the city.
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful.
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
I won’t consider it.
On top of her?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners, or because you’re just stupid?
I’ll tell her.
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people!
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-creature’s knife.
This one?
Sir, my brother is very fond of you.
Why, too much freedom leads to woe.
I hear a noise inside.
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them.
Signior Angelo, please excuse us.
Don’t worry about me.
Let me shake your hand.
When will there be another like him?
If you send them word that you won’t come, they might change their minds.
I wasn’t born to die on your sword.
Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart.
What’s the matter, lady?
That’s very true, mangy rascal, when it pleases God.
This box is too threatening.
He’s very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.
Go away and take your children.
I almost recognize that voice.
Can we do that?
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner.
Come on, let’s go see the king.
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio, and then we’ll journey on to see your son, who will rejoice at your arrival.
I didn’t give her any ring.
Yours are slow and awkward.
Where are you from?
I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.
She said if she were interested in someone, it would be someone who looked like me.
Well, what’s your plan?
They want to talk.
Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold.
Lord,” he calls you?
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” Don’t think about it so much.
Sir, it’s the Moor.
Anyway, what’s up?
I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
Come on, then.
All right, I understand.
Hail!
Come on, you’re fooling yourself.
You can have anything you want.
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar?
Brother— Quiet.
Ha ha, are you good?
As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.
I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.
Show me, show me.
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
Casca will tell us what’s the matter.
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly.
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.
We’re waiting here for you.
I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened.
Should I get your nightgown?
Carry him to my best room—gently, so he doesn’t wake—and hang all my erotic paintings around him.
It wants us to speak to it.
Kind and dear princess!
Oh, this is a painful time!
You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you’re willing to do that, you might as well just go and fight with him.
Oh, I hate looking at his face now!
It should work.
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated.
What can I do for you?
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking.
That was no show.
What will this do?
How did he look?
I, Wall, have done my part.
Which one is it?
Nice to see you.
Who’s been with her?
Here comes your father.
A man of great influence.
If the Jew cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Am I myself?
And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver.
Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.
When are you getting married, madam?
Why, man?
How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself?
Will it never be morning?
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses.
I’m indebted to you forever.
Her bridegroom is here.
If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years.
I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice.
Very well, thank you.
Come, let’s continue on toward your father’s house.
And you have mercy on me too!
I’m very sick, too.
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
But I beg you, don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you.
I’ll give it a try.
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this?
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support.
Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can’t be avoided, will come whenever it wants.
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather.
Madam?
As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.
The flags have fallen.
Here comes Sir Toby, limping.
He’s dead.
You must not go without having a drink first.
Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes.
A basting.
Four legs and two voices—a very special monster.
Farewell, then, Signior Lucentio.
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
I’m going to England.
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew.
Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.
Prepare the horses for your lady.
You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for.
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.
Don’t you have any sense at all?
Caesar is listening.
Oh, give us permission, great king, to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies.
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain.
Curse the day!
I had a dream last night about the three witches.
How are you, Charmian?
Come here, Ventidius.
Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest.
Call my sister that.
I did.
Ambassadors of Harry, king of England, request a hearing with your Majesty.
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.
Wish I could say the same.
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
Darling Kate!
Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered.
I beg your pardon.
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely.
Now I know better.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
Where did he get wine?
You’ve stolen both my job and my name!
For Hecuba!
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves.
Tom’s chilly.
There’s going to be a storm.
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
Amen.
Are you sick?
Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird?
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live.
What are you doing?
Do you want to go in and join the party?
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Brother, Duke, please have some food.
Don’t insult me with your distrust.
You’re absolutely right.
And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity.
From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.
Look with your ears.
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?
Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime.
Leave him alone.
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.
If they’ll do neither, we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings.
But why do you keep me here so long?
Well that’s good.
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
Oh, monstrous!
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up.
That’s it!
Yes, unfortunately.
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me.
If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.
It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again.
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear.
Oh, my daughter!
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
Then she has no choice but to hate you, as you purchased her love with murder.
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please.
You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
Don’t bother with it.
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies.
We won’t take their garbage.
He’s out of his right mind.
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins.
It won’t be long before I’m back.
I’m ashamed that I yielded to them.
One more thing, sir.
Indeed, it’s a strange time.
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.
I’ve come to take you to the senate house.
The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing.
I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.
Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here.
They have me tied to a stake.
Gentlemen, gentlemen—   Gentlemen, don’t speak.
Do you remember her face?
Out of love?
Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.
She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?
Burn!
Good!
Has he taken care of the music?
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
I will.
You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, hates you.
My lord?
What’s your answer?
And you’re all sizzle.
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?
Well, hello there, Horatio!
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage.
Where does he sleep?
Let it all go.
It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.
Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
I humbly thank you.
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.
Denmark’s a prison.
Don’t refuse the love we offer you.
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look behind you!
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.
Yes, revered Queen.
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself.
Fast asleep?
Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
I’ve said nothing wrong.
Shame on you!
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
What kind of fighting cock is this?
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight.
Dolabella.
Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat!
What a pain.
Dear God, please make him normal again!
Hello, sir.
They burn for revenge.
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming.
It’s all still yours.
Ha, ha, ha!
Romeo must die.
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for?
Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness.
She’s a virtuous and holy lady.
It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice.
This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.
If not, what can you do about it?
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
I know who you are.
That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more.
It’s true, he died on the day my sister turned thirteen.
Stay invisible.
What else?
A daughter?
My soul is full of sorrow.
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup.
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges: she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins.
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia.
There’s no other way.
But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.
You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down.
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.
I ate with him and my sister.
You think about him too much.
Is Claudio your enemy?
Look, here comes the woman you love.
Then I’ll listen to her.
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub.
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves.
Come on.
He’s furious because you insulted him, and he has a right to satisfaction.
I want you to see the difference between us, so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon.
Though our lives—   We have decided, my lord.
I beg your pardon.
Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.
We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death.
Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England.
Oh, come quickly!
Read the time there.
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of, yes or no?
I’ll find you another horse.
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.
You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death.
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
What else can I say?
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck.
You’ll  Enough of this.
Yoo-hoo!
If not, come when you have the courage.
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.
I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
He has captured Toryne.
And you, sir, what’s  Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere cobbler.
Octavius, I’m older than you are.
You stupid cop, stop your violence!
I’ll be nearby.
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.
And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air.
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s.
Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats?
I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is.
You attract me to you, you cruel magnet!
Right now I’d give a thousand 
Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home.
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.
I’m telling you this story for a reason.
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself. 
And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?
He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely.
No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench.
Once more I come to ask you, King Harry, if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat.
Oh, are you really!
But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case.
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
It was addressed to him, and orders must be obeyed.
If your wife’s not a madwoman, and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me.
Take care of the queen!
I saw it in the orchard.
It’s not true.
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men.
The original story was written in the finest Italian.
Yes, my lord?
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor.
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.
Yes, but these English are seriously short of beef.
I agree.
She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.
A nice message.
The British troops are coming near.
Hot, hot and moist.
When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
Yes, he does.
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
We age and die because they wear us out.
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?
When this wood burns, it’ll weep for making you tired.
Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest.
I was killed in the Capitol.
I never saw such a shameful act.
An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier!
I found him here,  Beating?
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
I’ll pay you for your trouble.
You do the same.
O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing.
Boatswain!
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
It hangs like an old worn-out mop.
What’s wrong?
They were lusting after each other.
Where do you think he is now?
Who did this to him?
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.
Who said that?
I rejoice in his good fortune.
I’ll be thrilled.
It’s mine and I’m going to get it.
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.
I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it.
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.
Sir, here’s the Queen.
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom.
Ready.
Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.
Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
CALIBAN  Stephano!
I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore.
No, I haven’t had lunch.
What we are is up to us.
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?
But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?
There’s meaning in your snoring.
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.
I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years.
How are you?
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
His imagination is making him crazy.
Now get out of here!
This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.
And you, sister?
Good night, brother.
Your Majesty, see here—if it won’t offend your Grace—what a complete, rascally, beggarly, lousy rat this is.
Listen to many people, but talk to few.
You lie.
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld.
He can sniff his way to Dover.
And what will happen if I don’t?
To tell the truth, though, I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man, except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph—I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man.
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a 
Come on, bring them in.
Is she really that wonderful?
This is  It is, my lord.
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning?
Is love really tender?
Then she ran away to grieve alone.
Why are you here?
I will, Caesar.
Let’s send this news to Rome.
Come on, sir, please.
Mine too.—Are you listening, monster?
I have to follow him and give him the letter.
Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical.
I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.
Don’t speak of this again.
I’ll lie here tonight.
Are you insane, talking like this?
Come with us to Athens.
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.
She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up.
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.
Yes, and be wise.
My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money.
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her.
So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst.
We owe you love and service forever.
But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat.
Keep your money.
I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion.
His words are like poison to me.
This, this All-Souls' day, is my just desserts.
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
Give me what I deserve, and do your duty!
My sword will talk for me.
I’m Lorenzo, your love.
It’s disgraceful!
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs.
It’s a horrible thing to die when you’re not prepared for it, my gracious lord.
What can I do for you, sir?
What’s the treasure, uncle?
It’s a miracle you’re alive.
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.
Come on, you turtle!
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day, or he might slap your head with it.
Yes, with Cassio.
I guess you don’t want it.
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.
I beg you to pardon me.
Hell and damnation!
It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out.
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
Caesar, you thought this would happen.
Don’t be upset.
But please, tell him how well I faked a faint.
But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
Draw your sword!
Hmmph!
Shame of what, lady?
Help!
Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him.
Her bottom.
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
More or less.
No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us.
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
But I won’t sleep till I get back.
This is it, for now.
I will see you tomorrow, then.
I’ll die like a swan.
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.
I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires.
Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents.
You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.
But come, lords, will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him?
Is this your idea of success?
I don’t care what you think of me.
Quiet!
I had no idea she was cheating on me.
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him.
You were right the first time.
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs.
Go after her, go.
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods.
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?
Welcome back!
Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world.
It will give you some protection from this storm.
He’s changed a great deal.
Here it is, I think.
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.
That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the  Good morning to you both.
We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that.
Oh!
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.
If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?
I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to buy this.    
Where the devil can Romeo be?
I’ve been so tortured since I lost track of you!
Madam!
The island must be mild, and have a temperate climate.
Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip.
It’s Cinna.
Between whom?
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands?
So stop crying.
Goodbye, good Mr. Love.
The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep you safe.
We want to hear the will.
I mean, with my head in your lap?
Follow it, follow it!
I know it.
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
If we lose, what do you plan to do?
I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated!
And that’s true—he  Then I pleaded for you.
Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.
Revenge.
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
Let me see you dance. 
You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle.
I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it!
If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God.
Come on, you and I will go soon.
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
Katherina, you may stay.
She has betrayed me and shall die.
That’s authority!
They left me and my servant there, tied together.
Goodbye, my husband.
What do you think about Thursday?
He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons?
We can’t go on with this plan.
I’m right behind you.
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?
Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good.
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough.
We’ll be your witnesses.
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.
What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia?
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
It really is good to see you.
Don’t get up yet.
Haven’t you, boy?
Farewell.
You need to.
Trebonius knows his cue.
We’re at your service, my lord.
But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money.
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?
That’s already been done, sir.
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.
Who is this bloody man?
Welcome, dear madam.
Hurry to a convent.
That really is an illegitimate hope.
Oh, really?
I must and will have Katherine for my wife.
Is it possible?
Let go of me.
Get rid of your low-class trapping,” she said.
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.
If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
You’re a fool.
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh.
He’ll grow up to be a proper man.
If we can do that, everything will be all right.
Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.
They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing.
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?
And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly.
I’ll make you sing.
I didn’t think you would follow me.
Lead the way.
Good Prince, say something!
Know the glove!
I don’t want anything more.
It’s your job in life to kill the innocent?
Do you recognize this face?
I’ll leave you, lady.
I’m here.
Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.
For the love of God, call a doctor!
I’m not coming.
Is that what he says?
That’s no way to pray.
Are you going?
Meanwhile, after you.
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.
But do you mean what you’re saying?
I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.
I’ll say good-bye now.
Yawn, snore.
We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi.
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
Leave Hermia alone.
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about.
You killed my child.
Huntsman, look after my hounds.
I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs.
Macbeth has come.
Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
I’ll confess to you that I love him.
Hurry up and get to your horse.
The adult snake lies in the ditch.
I’ll try talking to him again.
If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets.
Caesar’s talking.
I think so.
Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool?
Be bold, and get ready.
Damn you!
I won’t until I’m ready.
My dear lord, you know how passionately stubborn the duke is.
There’s something else to be done.
Worse and worse!
Good advice, indeed.
But he’s sleeping.
Let him mount the pulpit.
Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
Tell me what it’s about.
Oh, you men are made of stone!
I don’t think about them now.
It’s very hot.
Here, madam.
Now go, set up for dinner.
He had one yesterday.
March to meet him at a dignified pace.
You’re a spirit, I know.
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
Where’s the gold I gave you?
Whenever you’re ready, hostess.
There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.
Amen to that, Gonzalo.
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
I have the best armor in the world.
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God!
I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.
What does he say?
But as for now—before two weeks have gone by, I’m going to send some people packing.
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.
I assure you it is, madam.
Yes, I forgot—three months. 
You shouldn’t talk about him like that!
All right, stop this.
When I said that, I was angry too.
Neither good nor bad.
He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.
Hello, Cassio!
Tell me once more what you say.
He’s not brave enough to be wise.
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
Play me some music.
There’s nothing to fear in him.
Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon.
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil.
And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining.
But tell me.
Think about it.
Watch him closely.
Hello, you idiot.
It takes a wise father to know his own child.
What do you think about this change?
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to the bait.
So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside.
But you promise you can keep a secret?
As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire.
You will listen to me.
Go ahead.
In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him.
And now she’ll start moaning, of course— Are you asleep, my love?
You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince.
Lord, it’s glancing every which way!
I don’t dare, sir.
Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
And when I get my reward, I’ll get out of here.
I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two.—Goodbye, sweet lady.
Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see.
Oh, life is full of surprises!
It’s good you found me.
First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them.
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.
You are dead!
Go ahead, but I won’t listen.
Then tell them to treat us well.
Morning’s here.
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
Caesar might act like that.
Actually, I’d like a few pounds of grass.
Is that you, Iago?
No one admires speed more than the lazy.
Another studpid answer!
In Sicyon.
Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.
That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?
But come, my lord, let’s go.
Goodbye, my lord.
He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.
I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face.
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.
Yes, my lord.
That’s better than exaggerating our trust.
Amen.
The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer.
For himself to ruin,” he says.
Give me a little breathing space, my lord, a little pause to think.
What’s this noise?
But where’s my fool?
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— My nation?
I’d give it all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to save you.
Was it you that he rescued?
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running.
Isn’t he getting funnier?
My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!
Hello to you.
Do they seem religious?
Don’t say no.
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?
Look!
I’ll give you mine.
Well hello, my good boy.
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother.
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.
Why are you looking for me?
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own.
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.
Isn’t that enough?
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
You are Antonio, you are he.
Or was I dreaming?
I’ll do it right away.
I’m no ordinary fairy.
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.
Oh, you lowlife!
But if you fail, you have to leave immediately.
I’ve made my choice.
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.
Come on.
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Mine did too.
An illicit kiss!
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.
You’ve only insulted yourself.
I’ll pull on these smaller legs.
You’ll be lord of the island then, and I’ll be your servant.
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.
Even if we don’t fight foreign enemies, we’ll beat down these rebels at home.
Our handwriting gives away our hearts.
Isn’t my name Hero?
Yes, better than you know me.
Officers, take them away.
But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
Throw some of your words at me.
My master is standing out in the street!
But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven.
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him.
Did you call, my lord?
Men can be masters of their fate.
His eyes were as green as leeks.
I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master?
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor.
Mistress, you know about that.
He looks humbler than he used to.
He’s somewhere else in the house.
Is she dead?
Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
What’s the matter?
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged.
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.
I’m not really Litio.
I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night.
Well, until that time, don’t come near me.
You’re as pale as your nightgown!
If the job had been painful, I would not have come.
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
Boy!
What hope is that, may I ask?
You weren’t given any gold?
Anyway, he is what he is.
Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter?
It is for your ears only.
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
Hello, sir.
You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying.
Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently.
No, sir, I won’t let you go.
The honest men.
I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore.
I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof.
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.                
You get trickier and trickier.
Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you!
Oh, my!
Is it lunchtime?
Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money?
It’s a messenger from the warships.
Make it eight and eight.
Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.
So be careful.
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
It’s a deal.
Would you care to hear some music?
Won’t we, Sir Andrew?
Do you want to know the truth?
Welcome to Rome.
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament.
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
He loves them both.
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
But for a fine, elegant, graceful, and excellent dress, yours is worth ten of those.
What news do you bring?
He struck me from under your arm.
Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.
Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money?
Good Lord, how bright and splendid is the moon tonight!
What mistress do you have?
Fake, I’m telling you.
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections.
I’ve got to go.
I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry.
No.
Not at all, not at all.
There’s no need to be, really, for—  You’re my teacher, so I must believe you.
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty.
Oh, but I’m worried.
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.
He laughed at that and let me go.
So go ahead and cry.
Consider it done, my lord.
Master, master!
What kind of beard should I wear for the part?
If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Goodbye.
So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.
Quiet now!
Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched.
Show it!
No matter what you say, my father is not dead.
All hail, Macbeth!
That’s how we’ll do it, then.
Am I Dromio?
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now.
Caesar?    
Do this immediately, and send him packing.
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman.
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice.
I don’t believe it.
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund.
Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?
I’ll teach you a lesson.
Let me have your attention for a moment.
Well, it must have been Signior Benedick.
One?
No, I swear by my life and soul!
No, not until Thursday.
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
There’s music coming out of thin air.
I’d rather break my own heart.
I’m not sleepy at all.
I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters.
What you say is true.
They are harder than the stones the house is made of.
Here comes another Jew.
Didn’t you hear it?
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
God help me!
Then why be jealous of a person like that?
Tell the actors to hurry.
But why am I telling you this?
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.
Don’t talk to me.
God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases!
If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you.
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
Tell me.
You worthless girl!
What, you’re not a whore?
Don’t attack by land.
Thank you for all your efforts.
Oh, be quiet.
What are you going to do for her?
No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.
Come on, servant, come.
Fury, Fury!—Get over there, Tyrant, there.
Hello there, good sirs.
I won’t listen to you.
I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio.
As long as it’s honorable, you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.
When I ran into this holy man, those men you mentioned did come to mind, in fact.
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
But you had bad blood in you, no matter how much you learned, and good people couldn’t stand to be near you.
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart.
If you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes.
Soldier, you are.
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
Goodbye.
Bring the villain forward.
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
Shame on you!
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.
Saint Francis, help me!
He will if he lives long enough to become a man.
True.
Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?
What is my nation?
But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
Well, let’s have it, Grumio.
For what favor?
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.
I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon.
What is, my lord?
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.
It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest.
I need people as trustworthy as you.
It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation.
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please.
Oh, Cleopatra!
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
I see a voice!
No, it’s a story.
Don’t speak any further.
What’s that music?
Still, Edmund was beloved.
It looks like you’ve offended it.
A sword’s too heavy for you to wear.
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.
But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior.
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.
Okay, who does it trot for?
Don’t talk back to me.
So how short am I, you painted barber pole?
Let me live here forever.
And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early— I don’t know what the doctors say.
What’s this?
Please listen to me carefully.
I’ve changed my mind about that.
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so.
Are you my daughter?
Call the messenger in.
Music, listen!
No, just listen to me.
I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it.
Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see.
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth.
I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a fat goose.
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
Stay here for a moment.
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?
What a fool I’ve been!
To find a husband for her sister.
Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir.
When we were alone, we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant.
Yes, be content, good Touchstone.
Say something!
You see, her eyes are open.
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
He’s a king, a king!
What am I, a cane?
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
Where’s my fool?
You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key.
We’re safe from my father for at least three hours.
What are you saying?
Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar.
Thank you.
No.
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.
Do they come from good families?
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?
Eighty ducats!
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave.
Come, let’s go.
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.
Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him.
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives.
Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.
I watched him very closely.
To hell with you!
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.
The gods forbid!
have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back.
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
But who’s coming?
But don’t be afraid, Cesario.
Your authorization is ready.
But he’s not better than mine.
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.  
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.
If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
You’re older than me.
The actors are here.
He’s really taken this prank to heart.
My man Grumio!
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check.
Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower.
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?
Can you buy them with money?
I can’t offer her more than all I have.
Well then, add some interjections that indicate laughter, like  Hold on, Friar.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
Thieves!
Just obey me a little bit longer.
Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?
It is, my lord.
Did I work to make him king for this?
Wrong, evil traitor.
No, madam.
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.
By my birth I rank above you, but don’t be afraid of my greatness.
Check the calendar and come tell me.
Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!
God, what a burden on you I must have been!
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.
Yes, a thousand times.
Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime.
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news.
We’ll take you there.
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’s mercy.
God be with you.
Wait, don’t stand next to each other.
I didn’t realize he knew her.
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
What did he say?
I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
He has a very gloomy attitude.
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown.
I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders.
Little” again?
That’s most appropriate.
Come with me.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Can a man do it?
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
Armed, sir.
Good news, friends.
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
Should we part, sweet girl?
Why, that man is a total fraud and rascal.
That’s the deal.
Please answer, my good little student.
Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well.
Yes, I see them coming.
Is it good news?
Give him the goblet.
Good night.
Phoebe wrote it.
You men are rank beginners!
May good luck follow you!
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?
God will protect me.
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity?
I’d rather die.
I frown at him, but he still loves me.
Where’s that dog?
I do.
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
I’m sure it is to knight you, Captain.
My sweet, so do I.
Not us.
My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me.
How is it that you’ve come back so soon?
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
That’s not what I wish.
Then by all means never let her walk in public.
While he and I are at one, my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other, so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about.
Let us hear him.
And here I am, with that piece.
Give me your hand, Leonato.
Why are we talking about him like this?
I will choose this one and try my chances.
My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning.
Let me go.
I swear I will— Come on, let’s go see what happens.
Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition.
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.
Amen to that!
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys.
The boy was going to support me in my old age!
Good day to you, Captain Fluellen.
Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed.
Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?
No?
Please do.
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.
Look, here comes just the man we were looking for.
Both?
Cassius, stand firm.
What’s going on?
I wish they were, so that I could die right now, because, at this point, I live a living death.
Oh, he hasn’t?
Let’s leave him.
I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.
If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?
Yes, sir, I’m here.
I’ll give you more instructions later.
You are completely wrong about this king.
The gods forbid!
Come, come away.
Adieu.
Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?
I will, madam.
So that means she’ll come.
What does your grace want?
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet?
And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.
The Moor’s killed my mistress!
Who are you talking about?
Talkers aren’t good doers.
Then die and be damned!
I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man.
Many people, men and women alike.
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights.
That’s me, sir.
Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men.
You mean the sun!
Good heavens, those are difficult directions.
Just looking at him gives me heartburn.
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me.
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love.
Coward!
But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.
They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find.
I’m critical by nature.
My plans are almost at their climax.
My lord, most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard.
I’ll never see my gold again.
If he’s never drunk it before, it’ll help soothe his fever.
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.
I didn’t kill Lysander.
If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.
Oh yes, three thousand ducats.
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
My husband said she was unfaithful!
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
I feel sorry for you.
Wait, madam.
Tell me, are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet?
Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans.
You are an honest man.
But one word more— He will not be commanded by you.
You won’t, then?
He’s late.
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.
I feel awful for my cousin.
Farewell.
Can I have a word with you?
Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman.
I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes.
I am tired.
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words.
Can’t you see that?
But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you.
Are you trying to sleep with him?
Quiet, you stupid fool.
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.
She picks it up quick, doesn’t she?
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.
Who can tell me who I am?
I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.
Run, run, my lord.
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.
You’re in a bad mood?
You have wonderful armor, but give my horse his due.
Who do you mean?
What did he do to you?
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself.
How did they die?
He would just see me for what I am, a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples.
But tell me, Egeus.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.
Soldier, you must come to the king.
If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood.
You’ve done well at sea.
I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.
Sometimes snakes wrap around me, hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy.
My cousin’s a fool, and you are too.
But, tell me, is young George Stanley alive?
I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there and then come back again.
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward.
How are you, my lord?
If either of you were a prince’s son, and you were imprisoned as I am now, and two murderers like yourselves came to you—wouldn’t you beg for your life?
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market.
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell?
You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly.
Goodbye.
My lord, could I have a word with you?
Don’t try to tempt me!
Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil.
Come now, keep your oath.
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop.
Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me.
Be  Conrade!
Go, hurry.
When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return.
Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed?
That’s too long.—Servants, leave her and me alone.
Tell me, who had him arrested?
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.
Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army.
All is lost!
If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air.
I will die and leave Death everything.
Did Cicero say anything?
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s face—except my own in the mirror.
He’d begged me to steal it many times.
Oh God, do I have to remember that?
My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight.
What, are you hurt?
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?
M”—why, that’s the first letter in my name.
As long as there are 
Why won’t he?
Well, let it strike ten then.
We’ll do it.
He’s too argumentative for me.
Absolutely, yes indeed.  
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.
But I see you’re troubled.
And they respond to you with their hearts as well.
And then?
My Lord of Warwick, a most corrupt treason—God be praised for it!—has been discovered, as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day.
Good morning, neighbor Gremio.
You make me so happy.
I will, Caesar.
Let’s go.
I can’t remember how I cried then, but I’ll cry all over again.
And how did she react to all this?
Oh, this day has turned into a disaster!
Shame on you—get on board!
A lively young one!
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave.
What do you think I’ve got on my head?
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles?
What’s his name?
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.
Not the time I saw it.
Drive it out of you.
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?
Don’t deny to him that you love me.
Yes, Cassius.
Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book.
I’ll do whatever the king wants.
Were you dreaming, Lucius?
Cheer up!
Keep him away from me!
That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears.
Look!
We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys.
If you sit down, I’ll carry your logs a while.
She is worse than wicked.
Tell your wife to watch her.
Now I feel my soul leaving.
Thieves!
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms!
No, not until we see a hot January.
The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek.
Tyranny is dead!
You taught me language, and all I can do with it is curse.
This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all.
When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally.
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?
Strato, you’ve slept this whole time.
The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies, ha?
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
Hortensio and I have given you up.
I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship.
I didn’t.
Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.
Easily, madam.
In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.
The coroner’s inquest law.
Put out your torches.
Who are you?
But shhh!
If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again.
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.
How did you lose your breath?
Certainly not!
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence’s troubles.
He’s too overwhelmed with shame.
If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister.
This man looks like his business is urgent.
Give him this letter.
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up.
You always slip out of the argument like this.
Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying.
I wish I could sleep too—it would stop me from thinking.
I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite.
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough.
Stay down, heart.
Oh, that’s disgusting!
Sir, sir, sir—
Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use!
You are very welcome here.
Didn’t he say my brother has run away?
I hope you’re strong enough to do it.
Who tricked you?
I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married, and then I’ll go to Aragon.
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you.
Hey, Cassio!
Good morning, noble sir.
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life!
Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?
No!
What’s the matter?
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief, now it’s time to cheer each other up with love.
Doesn’t it look like the king?
What do you say?
Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
My own house, good lady.
Who delivered it?
Flee?
Set it down awhile.
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace.
So she is drowned.
Bassanio, let him have the ring.
The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
Well, that’s what you get to do.
My friends, remember that you’re my guests here.
Leave me alone.
Then why am I worried?
Oh God!
What?
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it.
You’ll get there two days before me.
I’m neither, my lord.
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!
You’ll get some of what you want.
I myself, who am more indebted to you than anyone, have brought you this young scholar 
Who’s there?
Show us the way, sir.
Tell me, why did the king arrive with such a small entourage?
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night.
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests, okay?
Kill!
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth, the true heirs of each royal house, be joined together!
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you.
I would, my boy.
To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.
Take care of the lady.
Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way, and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages, nothing taken that is not paid for, none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language.
So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings.
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.
Come to my room later on.
Excellent!
I’ll drink it if I like.
As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.
Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free?
Come, I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.
Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves.
They are my daylight, my life.
You know where I’ll be waiting.  
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
There’s a picture of me inside.
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?
In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer.
You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re talking.
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh.
Damn it, who’s there?
Who will thank us now?
I hope you’re right.
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground.
I was his daughter when you banished him.
Are you trying to remake me?
Demetrius is an admirable man.
What?
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.
For God’s sake, send somebody else.
Oh, mighty Caesar!
I can’t believe I was scared of him!
Oh, that was unbelievably low!
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
We’re not saying anything treasonous, man.
If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I.
Don’t go near Casca.
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
Carthage?
They’re ready, my lord.
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.
They say there are only five people on it.
Look, your wife is with him.
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!” People and senators, don’t be afraid.
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!
Quiet!
You.
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons.
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.
What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day!
So, where’s my wife?
Signor Brabantio, hey!
Very sad.
My dagger, little nephew?
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to. 
I’m losing this duel of wits.
It only looks a little paler.
I hear his trumpet.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
Who put out the light?
You are right, it’s for my mistress.
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.
Why?
Humble greetings, great master!
Come down, brother.
Where’s your father?
And when you do— Cassius, calm down.
Like hell!
The duke is temperamental.
Is that so?
Should be?
I don’t hear anything, madam.
I thank you all.
Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.
Go, you old housewife, go.
I have a good plan.
But so what?
Here he comes, my lord.
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you.
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before, and it’s not natural either.
Please be quiet.
So, the sun won’t shine today!
He will have only justice and his penalty.
Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old.
Please be careful.
Come, come, we’re worrying about the worst-case scenario.
Very impressive.
And so do I. I think we all do.
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
Why, then, it’s my body’s doomsday.
Yes, certainly.
It’s terrifying.
You’re on your deathbed.
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.
Well, then, what are you messing up?
The ship was already sailing.
What’s this song?
He’s right over there.
Murderer!
But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is.
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.
What I’m saying can’t anger him.
Oh, Pyramus, get up!
Can’t you talk?
I don’t like his face.
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.
Stay calm.
There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly.
I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about 
Good news, good news!
What was that cry for?
It’s certain.
You can refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not.
Are you really alive, Stephano?
We’ll meet you at sea.
That’s it.
This isn’t a monster, it’s a devil.
No more about that, please.
Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words.
Let it go up to heaven.
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do.
Oh, honey!
No, I must let them find me.
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave?
And listen!
That you love my daughter to spite your soul.
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words.
Oh, it’s too bad!
So young and so cruel?
I am satisfied.
Go away, get out of here, and stop following me.
Is the king awake, worthy thane?
And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.
Please lie down and rest a while, my lord.
Oh no!
Who?
Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now? 
That’s the necklace I gave you, sir.
Tell me what a drunk is like, fool.
Give me your hand.
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.
You speak so highly of fools!
He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure!
I’ll tell you privately.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates.
God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.
I’m glad.
Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too.
I’ll say goodbye once more.
All ladies love me, except you.
The tawny cat has meowed three times.
No, son.
Then both, or one, or anything you like.
I like the morning.
Yes.
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
You’re doing the right thing.
Short but still tedious?
Tell me the truth.
Well, well, well.
My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me.
He’s not getting anything except the penalty.
I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
Let’s go, we’ll obey you.
Give me Bianca for my inheritance.
Give me your arm.
And so will I.
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
Speak, speak.
With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix.
That’s what I want you to tell me.
Let him go, Gertrude.
I have to make do.
There’s certainly not a boy left alive, and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle.
Here.
For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes.
The reason is that it’s what I want.
I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate.
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
It did, it did.
Calphurnia, my wife, is keeping me at home.
Amen to that!
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.
Leonato’s daughter had told us everything.
What shall I do for you?
Who are the people who want to speak with me?
Away, away, be gone.
What can I do for you, madam?
Thank you, doctor.
She’s very moral.
You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.
Until then, think about the well-being of Rome.
His highness is not well.
I’d better not drink now.
I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world.
Oh, noble sir!
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater.
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
Why, my boy?
Over there, where Titinius mourns it.
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, come forward.
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
Don’t let them know fear.
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s?
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.
Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is.
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?
I’m a surgeon to old shoes.
Where did they disappear to?
Didn’t I buckle this well?
Who’s she?
Why do you look like a frightened goose?
Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him.
In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me.
Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you.
From head to toe?
Listen!
Many people faint when they see blood.
Does it mean being truthful?
Give me my veil.
I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales.
Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior.
Sure, and twenty others just like you.
The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically.
What’s all that shouting about?
I’m locked in one of them.
How did you sleep, my lord?
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.
Bring him with us.
Getting right to the point, I live near the Capitol.
A friend.
I’m wide awake.
Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous.
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.
Let’s fall on our swords.
The advancement of your children, noble lady.
I can’t even be sure these are my hands.
It does have a back like a weasel’s.
But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief.
My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
A strange fish.
Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition.
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.
The hour of death is approaching.
The Phoenix is my house?
I’ll join you, sir.
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself.
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.
Arm yourself.
If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen.
He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance.— I will indeed.
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
Mankind is so beautiful!
You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it.
Our hour is up.
I shook you and shouted at you, sir.
Don’t mess with me.
Follow them straight to the cottage.
Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life.
What happened, sir?
I’ll look for him and secretly help him.
I wouldn’t have dared!
Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them.
Now I’ll stand up.
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
So take your last breath.
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.
Good!
This is the place.
But so what?
I am ready for you.
I didn’t, my lord.
They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions.
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
Oh cousin, cousin!
What a fine sight!
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away.
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?
Romeo.
A prison like that would give me enough liberty.  
Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.
I’m sure you do.
Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Do you know any, Hero?
Puppet”?
All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.
So how did it go, sir?
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.
It won’t last.
Sounds good to us.
My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.
Is that a good idea, do you think?
Christ, it’s a disaster.
Oh love!
Come, come, hurry up.
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue.
Don’t you recognize me, father?
No.
If he wakes up before we kill him, he’ll never stop punishing us.
I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I don’t see what you’re talking about.
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.
But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days.
We’re talking here in a public place.
The highest-ranking?
Women are made for 
Take me off to jail?
The Moor himself is still at sea.
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
I wish you well.
Sweet saint, for goodness’s sake, don’t be so angry.
So listen up, princess.
What, should I stab him while he sleeps?
Come with me, Silvius.
That’s what made him crazy.
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding.
Get up.
And me, too, my royal sovereign.
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting.
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic.
I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.
My brother’s servants used to be my equals.
So, so, so, so!
You may leave.
Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.
Beware of March 15th.
I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind.
There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay.
Was it mine?
Where is my Romeo?
No more of this.
I’ll do it.
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come.
Do you understand what I’m saying, man?
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.
Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before.
It’s dangerous to talk about it.
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
A faithful shepherd worships you.
It’s not because I don’t love you.
Well then, don’t bother.
I pray to God he isn’t.
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
Here’s Romeo’s man.
And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it.
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.
Where am I?
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply.
I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say.
Oh, wine is the devil!
Dear master, I can’t go any farther.
If you wish.
Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters.
For a full half hour.
Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs.
Listen!
Is Scotland the same as when I left it?
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.
Give me details.
Silver.
Watch his reaction.
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him.
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness, but if I went on I could outdo it.
Wait, countrymen.
Wait!
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.
Yes, or to wear cosmetics?
I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.
All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew.
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
The king will already have left Southampton.
But that would ruin his reputation!
Yes, leave that labor to great Hercules—it’s worse than the previous twelve put together.  
Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Now that I think about it, I really want it.
It’s nine o'clock.
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God, the law, my honor, and her feelings?
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
My brains are injured.
I will go find him.
What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have?
As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes.
Relent?
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy.
Yes, my lord?
Do so.
You can be a eunuch, but I’ll be mute.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
What do you want?
Oh, Antony!
You’ve got a sword, Gloucester.
No, there it is again.
Who’s winning?
I’ve sent twenty people to look for you.
My God, it’s nauseating!
We have to be married properly.
But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on.
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
My name is Thidias.
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime.
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial.
Cassio!
Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.
What?
So get ready to leave.
Where should we stable our horses?
We heard it very clearly.
We didn’t please them on land.
Princes and counts!
Goodbye.
That’s the next thing on the agenda.
I’ll run, devil.
Whom did he leave in charge here?
I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.
Only God knows when we’ll meet again.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
Let’s see how.
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
You know what you know.
What is this news about?
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.
If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself.
I didn’t see them.
Not a second more.
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned.
Did old Bellario send you here?
Oh, that’s not true, my lord.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.
I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings.
My father, led by a poor peasant?
Let’s go to this great feast.
You weren’t good enough for her.
Do I mistreat even my enemies?
Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.
We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
Enough of your magic spells, you hateful, withered hag.
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
Where is he, in his bed?
Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.
Why Dover?
The king, the king’s to blame.
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean. 
Look at him.
Stand back.
I beg you, listen well.
Don’t think I blame you.
If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me.
I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.
Take his sword away from him.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
I’m not interested in being good.    
What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position?
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
What do you have to say to me now?
This is Caesar you’re looking at.
Tell us your name, sir, truthfully.
Some villain has told lies about me.
The second cock crowed.
Everything will be all right.
Poor imitation queen, why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web?
Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back.
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog.
I drew my sword to part them.
Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen.
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.
I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her.
Where’s Potpan?
Only for poor men?
Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go!
There’ll be hell to pay for this.
Great God of heaven, say amen to all this!
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.
All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right!
Don’t swear by the future, because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived.
I’ll follow after you.
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.
You do your job well.
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home.
How did you get better?
Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
How do you mean, “conspired”?
Do I know these men who are with you?
These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar.
Stop!
If he’s reluctant, I can convince him.
You’re right.
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.
Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying!
Where?
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest.
Wait a minute, Jew.
My name is Petruchio, son of Antonio, a man well known throughout Italy.
No, I know that you’re Signior Lucentio.
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man!
You mean however they dare.
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.
But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.
It is three o'clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle.
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?
But never mind.
This man is probably like that.
My lord.
You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.
That’s my way, when I see a crab-apple.
And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done?
You truly did.
Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever.
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.
You can’t go any further with us, sir.
Brutus, my country’s friend.
Therefore tell me, fairest Katherine, will you have me?
Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house.
Amen, amen.
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
Where did you learn that song, Fool?
Tyrant, show your face!
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
Who greets me so early in the morning?
Not even trivial things were left out.
No?
Goodbye.
I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been
The young generation rises while the old one falls.
That young man who was just here.
Killing pigs.
Good.—Now come, Ariel!
Well, anyway, goodbye.
It’s too small for your large mind.
Please, hurry.                    
Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions?
It was a rough night.
I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.
Do you smell something naughty?
No way, then, I’ll run.
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar.
I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me.
I myself am playing the man in the moon— Well then, that’s the biggest mistake of all.
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.
I wish I was your bird.
Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is.
And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter?
But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself.
Wait a minute.
I repeat, he’s in love.
Aren’t you a rational human being?
My lord, they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio.
Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath.
He and I will be there.
We’ll all want our fortune told.
Unfaithful, my lord?
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond.
That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there?
So, sir.
Don’t worry.
Give me your hand.
Then it must be Banquo’s.
I wish I were something better, because right now I’m a big fool.
What does he look like, Biondello?
Or stole it, rather.
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas.
Please, tell me your cure.
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.     
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home.
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.
No.
I’ll knock your teeth out, sir.
I have no choice.
Get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble Norfolk.
Read the will.
Who’s there?
While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night.
Farewell.
No, Lysander.
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master.
You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness.
So go in peace.
I hate to say it, but it’s almost two and we won’t get there before suppertime.
And I was right, because where’s your husband now?
Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy.
Master, knock hard upon the door.
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.
Prepare yourselves.
You killed this king, didn’t you?
The news is true, my lord.
You’re right.
Do you love me?
It said, “Love me and don’t leave me.” How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring?
Don’t be disturbed by my illness.
Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
Take me to Antony.
Seyton!
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town?
How old are you?
Let me enjoy my privacy.
Romeo!
Get out!
Whose was it?
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.
Ah-ha!
But there’s more work to be done.
I didn’t hear anything.
Good thinking.
No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.
Wasn’t he here?
When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.
It’s too bad.
There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth.
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
Because he’s daring us to do it.
Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that!
Yes, that was it.
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
I won’t stand for it.
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.
You’re a natural-born philosopher!
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience.
You’re absolutely right, your highness.
He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever—public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax.
And that’s true too.
Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
If I break the door down, slave, you’ll be sorry for this.
I wish you had told me you had a different father.
No, lady.
Lay me next to my mistress.
I put my trust in you.
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Claudio, I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child.
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
We, now at our largest, can only decrease.
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son.
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house.
Why, anyone can see what this means.
The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery.
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
But gilded tombs contain worms.
Oh, no.
Oh, here comes the storm again.
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
We must remember the gravity of this sad day.
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying?
You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier.
But you’ll have to catch me!
Help me, ladies!
Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways.
In the mud.
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night.
Treat Desdemona well.
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
Yes, I think that’s true.
What is it, Laertes?
Yes, right now.
What, isn’t my mother coming?
I didn’t find him at the Elephant.
I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house.
Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?
Lily-livered coward, what’s he doing there?
Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!
Oh, let us be merciful anyway.
Goodbye, my Desdemona.
Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze.
If this letter falls into your hands, think carefully about what it says.
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty.
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then France is yours and you are mine.
It’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please.
It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground.
No, madam, no.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person.
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
Let’s say goodbye to him.
Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights, squires, and brave gentlemen, five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday.
Pass on the command to halt!
That’ll be fine.
No, you won’t get a word out of me.
Please go back to Goneril’s house.
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.
Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.
But I’m wishing for something I already have.
No, after you.
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.
Oh, sweet England!
Halt!
You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.
This was the most unkind cut of all.
I want to stay more than I want to go.
I think I can find him.
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.
What kind of help do you need?
I know I won’t please you.
Then do so, with all your heart.
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.
Ask your husband if you doubt me.
So good-bye for now.
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
There is a way, ma'am.
I’ll show you how kind I am.
What, not even to pray?
So you had time as you were dying to look around?
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield.
Where did he go?
No, sir.
You’re not going, sir.
Here’s my hand.
It’s the wind.
Madam, with all my heart.
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.
It would be much appreciated.
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.
I  Isn’t this good?
Now this joke has turned serious.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Good luck.
No, ma'am.
Just notice.
My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you.
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this?
I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways.
Don’t let her say I kept you.
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
Where is my lord, the duke of Gloucester?
A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance.
Enough, cousin.
Why do you ask?
You’re going to die.
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.
I’ll miss you, Ariel, but you’ll be free.—Yes, you will, yes.—Go to the king’s ship in your invisible state.
Sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar, right?
Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.
It’s my men who should call me “lord.” I’m your man, your fellow.
And what do you know, boy?
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them.
This castle is in a pleasant place.
And what is this useless ceremony of kings?
But Macbeth is.
All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on?
Oh Iago!
Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here. 
Are your tears wet?
I might come back soon.
Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?
Ha, ha, ha!
Forgive me, your grace.
If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy?
Into my grave.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Will we be separated?
How did he say good-bye?
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn!
I will too.
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses.
Good morning to you both.
That’s the way of the world.
When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds.
He has his moods and his ways.
And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife.
But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough.
Let me at her!.
We are fortunate in the change.
That’s a good way of putting it.
Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you.
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving, unsteady state of ours?
If you’re Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
Why, Dromio?
Reading their mail isn’t as bad.
Donalbain.
I’ve separated them into groups around the island, just as you ordered.
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Moron!
I will mourn Hero tonight.  
No, villain, but you didn’t work alone.
We’ve got to act fast, my lord of the fairies.
Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.
Hurt him in eleven different places.
Good, sir?
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow?
Brother Anthony—
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
Did you hear that?
But silence, like a knife, cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood.
Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands.
I’ll fetch him.
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
Speak.
Sunday is just around the corner.
But that’s not how you’re going to be.
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
Please, give it to me. 
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
Do they attract big audiences?
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won.
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s?
God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue.
What’s this?
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand.
And the boys are winning so far?
But I’ll admit I don’t care for you.
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything.
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I’ve never gotten sick.
But where have you been?
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness.
I felt like skipping school, sir.
I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.
Well, let me get back to my choice.
You both know Banquo was your enemy.
No, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she’s been wronged, she’s been slandered, she’s been ruined.
Let me see.
A nice coincidence, my lord.
No, uncle, I won’t be married.
By our Lady, I think that’s true.
Everything about this is unnatural!
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.
I just know I’m not one.
Oh, it is my love.
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.
I don’t want to dance.
I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.
I don’t think he’d have any choice, my lord.
And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir, a princess.
You!
Look how shapely your legs are.
We will watch the execution.
Of what city, may I ask?
Has Fortune turned on me, like the whore she is?
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
Oh, make them joyful!
Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest.
I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said.
Take it back.
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
What?
But sir— Be quiet, Kent.
What a pretty picture, three fools all together.
Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.
Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.
Please, Horatio, go with him.  
Well, I don’t.
You represented yourself as just a common man.
My soul and not my child!
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.
This is Lucentio’s house.
Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him.
I don’t know his name.
Ha!
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?
He followed the old man.
Your preparation for war sounds like something.    
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.
Hello, my friends!
Come on, music!
C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool!
Who’s shouting?
Come, Katherine Queen of All, reveal your heart to me in broken English.
Come and see the proof.
Who is so low that he wouldn’t?
Is it good or bad?
If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?
I’ll stay, my lord.
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
It’s amazing, if I may say so, that she let herself be tamed.
I wish you all the best.
Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies. 
Actually, I should.
I am a villain.
Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting.
Bloodshed will force you to.
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war.
Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Thank you, sir.
Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you.
I won’t allow it.
Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.
He did, very sincerely.
That’s noble of you, master.
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Cicero is dead, by their decree.
It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you.
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.
Now, fellow, what have you got there?
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
I don’t see any Thisbe.
Please, who?
I’ll answer for everything.
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.
When it’s paid, bring your friend back.
It’s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one.
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it.
Have a good night!
Let’s see here.
Why, you silly man!
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
Alright, here’s the vial.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty.
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.  
His nurse, grandmother.
It’s not true.
You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome.
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin?
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
Let’s embrace 
I did it myself.
Miranda.—Oh father, I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that!
But you can’t see where you’re going, sir.
All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick.
I swear I won’t, sir.
Tell her. 
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, is very dangerous, and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud—it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects, not rulers.
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite.
Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.
The duke will agree with me on that.
So did I.
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful.
Here it is.
I will be angry.
You need to leave to take care of your own business.
Is the throne empty?
Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice.
Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me.
Father, wife, friends—farewell!
Cesario, you missed your appointment with me.
And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.
Lucius!
When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions.
Sweet Hero; when I imagine you now, you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you.
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.
You notorious whore!
The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house.
Hey!
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are.
I think I hear Antony call me.
From the earth, or the air?
Caliban!
Leah gave it to me before we were married.
I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
Don’t worry, sir.
When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
All these quarrels are about me.
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do.
I’ve seen both of you fence.
Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.
What, would you let a snake bite you twice?  
Do you think they’re married?
So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.
Ha, ha!
What’s that noise?
Run, everyone, run!
No, my dearest love, I wouldn’t cheat you for the whole world.
But did you see them dead?
Harry le Roy.
No, come to my cabin.
No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?
She’s been dead for some time.
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
Tell us.
And in a P.S.
No, dear Queen.
Tell me.
What were those things?
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
And mine say a hundred and forty.
Fabian, bring him here.
You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.
I’m coming.
Good lady, don’t be angry with the child.
Don’t push him too far.
Don’t even think about refusing.
Why do we party until we’re like animals?
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
Please, go away.
The worst thing imaginable has happened.
It will likely be a bloody fight.
I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.
Carved it up and down like an apple tart?
By God, it does look like a camel.
Be patient, your highness.
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves, and I will be king for my entire natural life.
There’s justice in heaven after all!
Am I a coward?
Oh, who did this thing?
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir.
If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question.
Why should he call her a whore?
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
Have you written that letter to my sister yet?
Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife?
He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon.
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice.
Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner.
Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter.
Tell me how.
Oh, please be quiet.
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now.
The crown was offered to him three times?
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.
Here, catch this box.
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name.
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play.
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
Antony.
A duke who is noble in name and character.
What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?
No stony tower, no brass walls, no airless dungeon, no iron chains can contain a strong mind.
If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.
To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads.
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.
He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language?
Always give him his way.
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.
Are you coming again for ransom?
She is welcome to stay.
hundred times.
We’ll start a fire.
When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man?
Heaven keep you safe!
Start the fire, good Curtis.
Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?
Hello there, sir!
Give me my robe.
Lead the way.
And so, good-bye.
Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.
But what about Cicero?
I’m all right.
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say:
Separate them.
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey.
Well, she can get used to it.
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today.
That’s why they say love is a child.
Why, so did you.
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
Borachio.
But I beg your pardon.
You’d make a good fool.
He’ll run after her.
Good-bye.
You know, you’re right.
Where are they supposed to come?
What in the world do you call this, tailor!
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time?
What, are you moaning on about your toothache?
Drunk?
Quiet, there!
No medicine in the world can cure you.
That’s good, Lion!
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?
Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much.
Oh, gods, give me patience!
I am glad he’s coming, however he’s dressed.
Well done!
On, on, on, on, on!
Mustardseed.
Get away from me!
Hey, Brabantio!
Don’t make me do it, my lady.
Know that I am Brutus!
What?
Leave.
You are very welcome here, sir. 
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven help you!
Please stop, sir.
Three thousand ducats, hmmm.
Well, we’ll see how you act.
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
I’ve never seen such a monster.
No, leave him alone.
The other half goes to the state.
How are you, soldier?
for the other men, we can make them believe anything we choose.
I won’t keep you very long.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back.
It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about.
You gentle Romans— Quiet there!
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
O Harry’s wife, do not triumph in my sorrow!
Decius, go tell them that Caesar won’t come.
Yes, I swear.
Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.
If this were a play, I’d complain it was unrealistic.
But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love.
I’ve got no hope that he survived.
I think you are.
There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his bravery, and death for his ambition.
But you began so rudely.
My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.
My lord, you don’t need to apologize.
And I’m her father as well.
I can’t, ma'am.
You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do.
You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you.
What music should we play then?
Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
I won’t either, sir.
The captain who brought me to shore has my women’s clothes.
Isn’t that him on the ground?
Was a man ever as dirty as me?
What do you think you’re doing?
Okay, let’s go!
I must admit your offer is the best.
Is this the cure for my aching bones?
I’ll go to Ireland.
Do I, sir?
He doesn’t seem to be alive.
Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
I thought you were resolved to do this.
What are you going to do now?
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.
My niece already thinks he’s insane.
I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself.
You didn’t want to go then!
Will they stop working when their voices mature?
My eyesight has always been bad.
I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
The two of them were separated during the storm.
So good night to everyone.
How could you ask?
I’m very glad to see you.
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have mercy.
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage?
What’s the matter with you, madam?
The Duke’s in a meeting?
Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt.
My father—I think I see my father.
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me.
Those are the things we pine for now.
I’m leaving your court now.
Gouge out his eyes!
They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.
You’re not as close to death as you think you are.
Go!
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes!
You look like you have something more to say.
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
You know too much about suffering.
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do.
But now, I tell you—keep it to yourself, though—those enemies of mine are being put to death today, and I’m better than I’ve ever been.
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio.
Where’s the king?
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom?
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Would I send a lie?
It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote.
If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction?
You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Which one of them should I pick?
Why do I have to do that?
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
You too, Fabian.
What part of the agreement did I break?
Isn’t she proud of such a match?
Come along with us, Signor Fabian.
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral.
Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
Alas, grim death, how vile and ugly your near-twin, sleep, is!
I would have met you by sea and again by land.
Come on, you.
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up.
Go in, or we’re done for.
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous—they all mean the same thing, with some variation.
I’ve got a plan that will fix everything.
Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment.
Where have you been, my bravery?
As the sonnet says, “If you please one special person, you please everyone who matters.” Why, what’s going on?
Benvolio, who started this fight?
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave.
What foolish thief brags about his crimes?
You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold.
The other half goes to the state.
Explain.
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.
Your case is better than that.
So do all thoughts.
I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful.
I doubt it.
Which is either a fool or a nothing.
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Stay and speak!
That may be true, my lord.
I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?
He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him.
And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too.
If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man.
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome.
Here’s to your health.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!
Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
Let’s hope we never need your help for anything.
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination.
Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
I did.
Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here.
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country.
Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret!
Farewell.
Here he is.
Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
Farewell to you both.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
So what?
And so farewell.
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer.
crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies.
who can control his fate?
Don Pedro is here.
No, most likely.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
I think I hear the drums far away.
Which ring did you give away, my lord?
Your answer is so strange!
If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers.
Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
I hid under this monster’s cloak to get out of the storm.
The strangers are all gone.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.
So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this 
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
My lord, here is the entrance.
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill.
One of you go call the Jew into court here.
You don’t know?
But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well.
I am their father’s mother.
It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.
There!
You know the law.
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.
Oh I hope that’s not true!
Well, call them back again.
Get to the point now.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your eyes.
Why are you doing this?
My lord, your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp.
Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?
If you see anything else, let me know.
As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.
And time itself is ended.
Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing.
Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.
He speaks well.
If you can’t do it, be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin, if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out of our way, I’m telling you.
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind.
But listen to me; let me guide you.
Smile, then, on this beautiful union.
Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.
Your darling?
You rudely snuck out of bed.
Be content.
No, it doesn’t mean anything.
For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.
I’ll take a look at your letter.
You’re talking about killing?
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
Yes, sweet Rosalind.
That’s enough.
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Certainly.
Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.
Here, at your service.
Good-bye.
Why are you asking me that?
They keep up Adam’s profession.
What are you going to do for a father?
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with, I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments!
I can see you don’t like this gentleman.
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is.
What victory does he bring home?
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.
Invite all my sad captains.
Please go, sir.
I’m telling you, just watch his face.
Your two sons?
Am I all alone?
And so, on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought, our scene flies swiftly on.
But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting.
What do you say?
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I have offended.
Good morning, Richmond.
I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.
I showed it to you once.
Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.
How smooth and cool they seem!
And to you, most noble Caesar.
What are you talking about?
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet.
Has she told Benedick how she feels?
I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face.
Is that true?
What do you think he wants?
Don’t take too long, unless you want our king to come after me to ask what’s holding things up, because he’s already landed here.
And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her.
According to an agreement, I should wear it myself.
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.
Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?
I’ve got no food to give you.
Follow me.
Speak.
Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood, and you aren’t affected by my curse.
Beware of March 15th.
His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail.
Be patient, because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now.
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
Myself?
Besides, how have I offended you, my friends?
Cleopatra summoned him.
What else could you possibly think of me?
Oh, please let me.
As it is God’s will and pleasure, Captain, I entreat you to come quickly to the king.
He ran out that way, sir, when he couldn’t— Follow him, now!
I’m being called.
No, calm down.
This is Casca.
Here’s some money for you.
When should the three of us meet again?
Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away.
My name is Proculeius.
Go to hell, you whore!
Don’t joke about his predictions.
Let’s go back to court together, but 
We want answers.
In my imagination, Horatio.
Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.
So, listen, Hermia.
You’ll find out everything in due time.
Come here, monster, put some glue on your fingers, and carry away the rest of these clothes for us.
You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.
Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me.
Yes, him, woman.
Tell him my fury will abate, and I’ll take the crowns.
My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.
Oh, if only I were a man!
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one.
You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back.  
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
Find out who did it!
You’re making fun of me.
I’ve seen her do it.
Not bad; you might accomplish something.
You said it when you were furious.
Stay near me so I’ll remember.
Who will advance with me?
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
I would have made it short.
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
I never talked with her in my life.
My liege, this was my glove.
But where did this happen?
Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing.
You’re sure full of smooth answers.
We have not yet set the coronation day.
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king.
I hope you haven’t lost your mind.
Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty.
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial.
Give me comfort.
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.
Great happiness!
Oh, what a villain I am!
But wait a minute!
Good afternoon, my dear lord!
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.
You’re a well-dressed lady.
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict.
A piece of ice.
Order them to move back.
Send me away?
Can you feel your legs?
She can’t even imagine what “love” is.
He’s fine and healthy, madam.
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.
We’ve been betrayed!
Don’t worry about how I handle it.
No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating.
I got it from him.
For a necklace your husband had him make.
Our business now is mourning and grief. 
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
Run to the Capulets.
I have no idea how.
Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated.
Hello, sir.
Go bring them here.
It’s the former Hero!
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.
I’ve promised to make everything right.
If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. 
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves?
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
Let’s not fight over this fellow.
We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules!
What are you saying?
If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
Wait, don’t rush!
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
Yes, I swear.
The street is narrow here.
Well, there they are.
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry.
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
Ha, ha, ha!
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise. 
I’m that great gust to her fire.
But
I think it was at sea.
You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
Damn you, don’t mock and sneer at me.
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” Oh, how monstrously evil!
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke’s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half.
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy.
Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!
I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it
A kind good night to all!
It’s our destiny, like death.
Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.
Or is he walking?
You’re Lear’s shadow.
is yours.” And, though I say so in his presence, if he’s not a friend of the best kings, you’ll find him king of the best friends.
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory.
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like.
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French,  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it.
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?
What does he say about our marriage?
Good night.
My leg’s been cut in two.
What’s wrong?
Oh, I’d never be that cruel.
What do you want to tell me?
You’re welcome here.
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.
If you survive, I’ll live.
He is what he is.
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia.
What do you mean by all this?
You’re making me go off-key.
He ran to his house, stunned.
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?
Get us out of here.  
Into God’s hands.
Tell her to come here.
It might as well be the same with Caesar.
But people often screw things up trying to make them better.
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.
It’s impossible.
No one’s heard from him.
But please, forgive me, your highness.
Good morning, old Sir Thomas Erpingham!
By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
I feel I should recognize you and that man 
Ask your daughters for another one.
If only you were, sir.
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely.
It’s pretty.
And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell.
Musicians, come in!
Goodbye.
Friends, go.
Are you riding far?
You should listen to reason.
Not with any sauce they could provide for them.
And I see her also through the eyes of love.
Now he’s a little crooked.
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us.
She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass.
No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week.
We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday.
But what did you want?
But Edward is still alive.
The woman I love is beautiful.
No, madam.
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games.
You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body.
My God, I’m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language—if only we were back where it’s spoken.
Let me lick your shoe.
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.
Come on, get ready.
No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt.
To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad.
Did you think I was talking about sex?
No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.
Oh God of battles, bolster my soldiers' courage.
What did I do wrong?
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
Macbeth.
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!
Do you have it with you?
But please, tell me: is he coming home?
He’s not here.
You did.
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
Has it come to this?
In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.
Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one!
Really?
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy.
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.
God give you joy, Petruchio.
Pass the order along.
I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face.
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.
What did he say the symptoms were?
Go on.
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.
He said she was unfaithful?
Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter?
I had you figured for a piece of furniture.
Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go.
I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
Tell me!
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you.
Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent.
Harder, harder.
You, sir?
You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
Oh, what a sinful thought!
They’re all dead.
Is it “chaste in word and action”?
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.
When will he be here?
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle.
Why would you celebrate it?
I hear him.
Here he comes.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
I’ll go to him.
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
She didn’t ask anything?
My happiness and yours lie in her.
Lose nothing?
He is worth no more than that.
This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character.
God be with you all.
God keep me so.—Heralds, go with him.
Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
Appear before me now quickly— No talking.
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen.
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
Good night, good night.
rules my life.” Hmm, let me see, let me see, let me see.
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
I had to send it to him.
Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears.
But goodbye.
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Give me some ink and paper.
No, please, save it for dinner conversation.
We’re close enough now.
What, in our own house?
I wonder if you’d be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek.
Let’s stay and hear the will!
Stand away from the body.
Oh, Fate, come, come to me, with hands as pale as milk.
He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him.
Away, get out of here.
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
Back so soon?
Thank you.
Poor Tom’s chilly.
I bet it will.
You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue.
Have them come in.
I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder.
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale.
I know the man well.
Is that the man?
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.
Yes, they are.
I will, as surely as I am a gentleman.
What’s going on, Borachio?
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
Get it, sister.
There’d be no kingship— He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.
If they refuse to come, get physical—use a whip if you have to, but get them out here to their husbands.
You’re a traitor.—Off with his head.
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
Captain Macmorris, I beg your pardon, but would you grant me a discussion or two with you, see, partly touching on or concerning the practice of war, the Roman wars, for the sake of argument, see, and friendly conversation?
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight.
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.
No, sir.
Is your little pearl in there?
Go home, you lazy men.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun.
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?
You’re a lying, cowardly wretch.
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes.
You stopped me.
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.
All right, have it your way.
Did you see Octavia?
Please hire Cassio again.
How are you going to live?
The tunnels!
It must be a spirit.
Oh!
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.  
No.
Don’t you know he has?
I loved one speech in particular.
You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.
The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in.
By the future.
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling?
Who’s that coming?
To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes!
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.
It’s incredible—they didn’t say a word.
Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains.
That she did.
The life”?
I can’t wait to meet her!
If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.
Get a little sleep.
You are to bring his daughter to the supper.
Is the news good or bad?
Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.
Would you like some more sauce to go with it?
Romeo is coming.
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of.
Nonsense.
If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away.
She’s well.
I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much.
Stop fooling around.
Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Death and damnation!
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.
My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first.
Well, let’s hope your good fortune continues!
That’s how it will be for some other men, too, who think they’re as safe as you and I, who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham.
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.
I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past.
Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal.
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?
I’ll fight you.
Go then, goodbye.
I’ll remember.
With all my heart, I’ll go right away.
Oh earth, which soaks up this blood, revenge his death!
Tell her to put her mind at rest.
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.
That’s true.
I want to avoid that.
Was it a man?
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
I’ll follow you, my lord.
Did he get away clean?
Don’t say anything.
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception.
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
There she is, over there.
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me.
I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer.
You still haven’t said anything incriminating.
Send for him, dear uncle.
You should always be honest.
Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.
Yes, if Messala recommends me to you.
Am I in France?
It’s revolting!
You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape?
Cassius, go to the next street and divide the crowd.
Goodbye, sir.
Then you were right on target.
If they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question, you would’ve deserved it.
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
She’s yours.—Come, Ariel!
Let’s go find him and cheer him up.
He has brought you figs.
Well, first there was the prince from Naples.
She’s alive.
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
I’m not staying here to argue anymore.
You’ll make me angry.
Oh, let me speak!
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
Don’t tug on my clothes.
Now, madam, undress and come to bed.
I thumb my nose at superstitions.
Richard, a fiendish spy for hell itself, still lives, but only long enough to buy souls to send below.
Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.
If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.
Here’s the east.
Ha?
First of all, my house in the city, as you know, is filled with expensive furniture and household articles, china and gold, basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in.
What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord?
Oh, stop, fool.
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately.
He’s bound to Octavia.
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know?
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning.
You want proof?
If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you.
And you’ve come at a good time, so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today.
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.
Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done.
She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!
I’m not sad, my lord.
I’ll do everything she wants me to do.
Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
The rest of the king’s guests are already inside.
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Where, sir?
Is he here?
Please invite them in.
I’ll tell you, good Brutus.
Put it together with something else.
Indeed, he’s not right for this.
I can’t run away.
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for!
Thank you for that joke.
With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love.
Do you know where I’m going?
Your light dulls when he is near.
And I swear to God he’s very smart.
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.
What’s that?
Didn’t you say something?
Stay with us tonight.
He’s having a fit and talking nonsense.
If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it.
Yes, my lord.
I’ll show you where to get fresh water.
Ah, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward!
So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.
But brother, I have some strange news for you.
But you’re all wound up about fashion, too.
You can see my ribs so well you can count them.
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a brave man.
You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.
The friar’s ready.
I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me!
This is amazing.
I ask for him, and he comes.
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny.
Yes, on his front.
I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment.
When his god falls asleep, the monster will snatch his wine bottle.
Damn him!
Why, what’s the matter?
Are you begging, brother?
Ah, I’ve got it!
Monday, my lord.
May the gods destroy you!
All right, then.
They haven’t been commanded to go to the west, mighty king.
You’re thinking something.
What else did you hear?
Poor man!
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible, challenging every enemy he sees.
Here, sir!
Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!
Sir, that would be me and my partner.
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
Oh, there’s the problem.
Come down.
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine.
He never did harm that I heard of.
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.
What if she’s pretty but stupid?
If it takes all the wine in my bottle, I’ll cure him.
You had this child with the help of heaven.
Hurry up, my Jewish friend.
Romeo, get out of here.
Not me.
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.
No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me!
Remember who liked your yellow stockings—” Your yellow stockings?
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
Don’t say that, my lord.
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do.
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.
That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.
What do you mean I faked you out?
I’ll wait patiently.
It’s as silent as a graveyard here.
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
I don’t have the cash right now.
Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.
But even so, we can’t do without him.
Listen to me, Beatrice— Talking with a man outside her bedroom window!
Mark Antony will say I’m not well, and to please you I’ll stay at home.
It was just moments ago.
You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
It is the best horse in Europe.
What should I say?
I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were 
There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius!
When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man.
She has a body, not a life.
And when has he ever been known to wash his face?
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother.
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.
Who’s sleeping in the second chamber?
But I am thankful that you have found it.
Yes, I will.
I’ll read it to you.
My name’s Roderigo.
Then you’re a better man than the king.
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike.
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world.
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
You admit it, then?
I have more reason to be distressed.
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty?
That’s true.
You and I, Kate, we are the makers of custom, and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize, as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss.
Ha!
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven.
My lord, what’s wrong with you?
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
Let me play the lion too.
He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man.
Yes, by God, that it is.
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
You mean I should groan and tell you?
I know how his mind works.
My employer is as good as yours.
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
I don’t know, madam.
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.
If I don’t answer, perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me.
Yes, from Normandy.
How is my generous sister?
No, come on, one more time.
Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature.
Get away from me, Satan!
If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
But honestly, I should have been a woman.
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction?
You lying brat.
If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it.
Yes, he said something in Greek.
What is your name?
That’s not necessary.
What do you want from me, my good man?
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.
Who’s in there?
Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England.
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
Do you want me to lie, madam?
Your children will be kings.
Name them.
Go!
Now I’m alone.
Fight to the death” is his motto.
Get him, he’s a thief!
Let me be your servant.
Believe it.
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.
I know you from before.
I was told that by one who knows him better than you.
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you.
Good morning to you.
I pity England, but not myself.
He’s asking him to tell the story again.
Can your man keep a secret?
It’s so simple!
Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice.
You’re getting in the way of our work.
I’m not much of a drinker.
What does Caesar want?
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless.
Give me your hand.
You are nothing like Mark Antony!
Here comes the Emperor.
It was armed, you say?
Will you fight well?
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes.
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
No.
He is definitely not there, sir.
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death.
My noble kinsman, welcome.
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
I think he really is angry.
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?
Don’t.
I don’t know, ma'am.
They shout for joy.
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
A witty if a cynical reply.
I’ve had very little joy as England’s queen.  
The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.
Give him this deed and have him sign it.
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
It means peace and love and a quiet life, supremacy based on reverence and profound respect, and—not to go on and on about it—everything that’s sweet and happy.
The duke will be here tonight?
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Snip and snip and cut and slash—it’s got more holes than a sieve!
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this?
I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me.
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl?
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud, showy ferocity, too, leaving their brains behind with their wives.
Oh, it’s horrible of her.
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?
Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man!
I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
If I can tame him, I’ll charge as much as I can get for him.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
Is she as tall as I am?
Peter, wait for me at the gate.
The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.
No, the whole day, and all night too.
If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives.
No matter.
Just now.
Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
And he’s still warm, by God.
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated.
I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter.
Thank you very much.
When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.
This story breaks my heart.
Varrus and Claudio!
I didn’t refuse you.
No, who are  Long live the king!
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.
Kill him rather than let him leave this room.
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me!
I will fight him there.
My good lords, I plan to.
I can’t see ahead of me.
Demand.
Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love?
Montjoy.
Bad news, my lord.
How can we tell which of us is the oldest?
Or ask you to leave the room?
And like I am for Ganymede.
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
I’ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood.
Are these our eyes?
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!
Please, come to his house with me.
Gracious brother, I will go with them.
Go, bring him here, boy.
Sir, these accusations should be answered.
Go to bed, and sleep.
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.
We don’t know.
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
Where’s your lute?
Leave all the rest to me.
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds, take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries.
Whatever we decide to do.
I won’t bet on whether or not any of this is real.
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.
I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world.
Good morning, sweet Hero.
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.
Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house.
Don’t come near till you hear me call you.
If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him.
That was the limit for me.
You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him.
Who were you chasing with your sword?
That’s true, lieutenant.
But I will go out, for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me.
I’m speechless.
These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.
Take him away!
You’re not in love either?
So go and put your stamp on the girl.
Write down that Prince John is a villain.
Who’s shouting?
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?
My old bones are tired.
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
Has anyone offended your Worship?
Please avoid doing that.
I thank you very much on his behalf.
You’re in love?
No, he loves and cherishes me.
Do you know any, count?
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest?
That’s true, and with good reason.
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice?
Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me!
Damn your mistress!
These are tricks.
But we’ll obey.
You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. 
Look!
Yes, that’s the one.
What would you like, Laertes?
This is the most miserable hour of all time!
If you go outside, arm yourself.
If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to.
Count how many times the clock chimes.
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket.
Well, well, well.
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land.
I’m out of breath, sir.
You brazen whore!
Buck up, boy!
He was an admirable king.
I don’t care what he told you in Latin.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression.
What about that?
Are you thinking about me?
Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!
When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier.
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?
I’ll hide in the arbor.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Oh, chest, obey me!
Why would she write to Edmund?
Damn that crazy madman!
I’ll wake him, because that’s my job.
Do you?
Do tell.
No epilogue, please.
You have weapons?
Is there anyone to give the bride away?
What’s that noise?
I am not a child or an infant.
Let’s go to the temple first.
As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.
One thing is certain: he’s out of control.
We’re not going to run in our army, Monsieur Monster.
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
I curse myself for doing that!
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree, quite outside of his own sphere.
Why, what’s the problem?
In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.
What’s wrong with you?
How do you mean?
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world, encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home, where there’s little to be found in the way of experience.
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war.
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight?
Where are your leather apron and your ruler?
For shame, bring Juliet out here.
Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.
If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in.
Didn’t he come home last night?
I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.  
Fear will keep you safe.
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
I don’t know.
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.
Follow”?
Go on.
Oh, say it, and mean it!
And like I am for no woman.
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
He’s like a cowardly 
Call yourself your own sister, because I want you.
If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world.
But I just can’t love him.
I hope you are pleased with the snake.
This is the way to trick gullible fools.
Of course I will.
And if anything important happens, find me and let me know.
I humbly say goodbye.
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping?
Are you drunk?
Is Clarence dead?
Isn’t every living thing condemning her?
Are you his brother?
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him.
What do you say to a calf’s foot?
Listen to the noble Antony.
Are your doors locked?
Was there ever a match put together so quickly?
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
No you haven’t, cousin.
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
Then everything must really be finished.
You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower, as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse.
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France.
And after that he came back here looking so serious?
Large and increasing.
I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.
I think that on a night like this, when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound,  On a night like this,  On a night like this,  On a night like this, 
But where is my love?
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
You may, Mark Antony.
If I can believe my eyes, this is a fine sight to see.
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.
You come from heaven, don’t you?
He won’t have a chance.
Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look.
No, that’s not it, trust me.
It applies to you as much as to me, my lord.
Yes, that’s the one.
If you look closely at Alexander’s life, Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything.
To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case.
Everything we’ve heard is bad.
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture.
Who’s dead?
I should always be wise.
Yes, it’s just clothing.
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.
We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions.
All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands.
Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her.
But for one reason they refused to execute her.
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. 
When was the last time you saw my father?
She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors.
Carry your master out.
No, first let’s talk to him.
I’ve got some business to take care of.
I’m not Stephano, I’m a walking cramp.
Since you’re giving me new assignments, let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet.
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves.
And then Pyramus showed up.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.
Yes, that’s the idea.
I did, Malvolio?
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.
Maybe it’ll come again.
Such exercise!
If I told you that, what would I get out of it?
Yes.
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
Then I guess I was misled.
Catch me if you can!
Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold.
Two or three men are groaning.
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small.
If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service.
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?
Let the ship sail close to the wind.
Killing him once is not enough revenge.
Welcome, lady.
Say anything.
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.
Here he comes.
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.
My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule.
Oh, he’s good at bending words around!
Did it stay a long time?
I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens.
That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts.
Pay attention to the music.
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.
This is our station.
What a crazy island this is.
Me, uncle?
She’s full of good advice.
I haven’t seen anything.
The Queen is coming.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.
Silence!
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
The Hero that died!
Yes, and more.
Did I do anything good to myself?
Leave it alone, you fool.
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?
I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord.
There will be no lecture.
This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!
What color is her hair?
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head?
My lord, he just left here.
Sit between us.
Sir, what is your opinion of me?
Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
That’s true.
Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent.
Me too, my lord.
Good morning, General.
Yes, indeed, it was, and he pushed it away three times, each time more gently than the last; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted.
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere!
Yes, why not, my lord?
Yes, Casca.
What are you going to do?
Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!
Are you rich?
I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work.
To work for you, sir.
Yes, and a nice one at that.
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden, or I’ll kick you out of my kingdom.
I was never disloyal, and I never will be.
Be good.
That’s the right attitude.
That’s impossible.
You’re in trouble either way.
That’s a good song.
Who’s there?
The servants Macbeth killed.
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
Do your job.
Where is that messenger?
I swear to God I won’t.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
What?
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.
Nonsense!
Fine!” he says.
You old traitor, repent all your sins.
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend.
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
And that would be—?
This is the door.
What “passion”?
What captain do you serve?
I’m telling the truth.
And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry!
That’s a wise idea.
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
Arms, make your last embrace!
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast, ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea.
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
It’s all stopped.
Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness.
It must be.
I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor.
Oh, she’s so witty and creative!
No, it’s dreadfully steep.
I’m happy about that.
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
Is it young Romeo?
In that case it’s good to be a post.
For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Where are his eyes?
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
I’d never play pranks on you.
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot.
Good luck, fair gentleman.
Affection!” That’s nothing!
You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission.
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties.
If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too.
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept safe.
I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood.
Is that a tradition?
No, good goose, don’t bite me.
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.
He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.
Keep an eye on Cinna.
Go back to bed.
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what  I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says.
The will, the will!
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
What do you say?
Come on, get ready.
Let’s see.
I meant they had to give her credit.
Then sing it.
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results.
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
No rescue for me?
The other voice is harsh and abusive.
Squabbling?
My wickedness?
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
I’ll call you a minstrel.
Well, let’s watch it.
Why do you care that he loves Hermia?
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed.
And go away, witch, go away.
Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood.
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you.
Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.
Not one drop sooner.
That’s a nice hat you’ve got there.
But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another.
It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed.
You teach me how I should act.
Which of you does not tremble when you see me?
You good-for-nothing, let me in.
With Cassio?
He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him.
Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both on one horse?
I’ll meet you there in an hour.
Oh, if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren’t working today.
Othello isn’t any of those things.
My lord, he refuses to come.
Where have you sent the king?
Was a man ever so tired?
From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story.
Good to see you, Iago.
What’s the problem?
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.
What’s up, mister?
them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours.
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.
My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood.
No, longer than that.
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run.
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Oh, these men, these men!
Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords!
So be quiet.
It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
Maria!
Give me that letter, sir.
No harm was done.
But I’ll see you soon.
But I promise you, Kate: the older I grow the better I’ll look.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
I didn’t accuse you of lying.
We don’t doubt it.
He’s welcome too.
Fair enough.
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home.
Shylock, are you listening?
Tell me to tear up this contract.
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him.
Give my regards to your daughter.
But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known.
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
I will do so.
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
What are you doing?
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?
But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long.
By this sword” is an oath, and oaths must be kept.
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.
So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus.
I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon.
Oh, dear!
I’d rather be wooed by a snail.
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?
The king is insane.
Please give me that.
This is a pitiful sight!
If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me.
Oh wise judge!
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Can’t you see I’m eating?
Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!
Six or seven thousand, at most.
Gentlemen, on to the bridal dinner.
Everything is a sick joke.
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
Look out, I’m on my way up.
I hope things go well there.
Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms!
They’re as opposite as hot and cold.
Can I have a word with you privately?
By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back.
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
All right, sir, I will.
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it.
Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks.
This will either make us or break us.
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard.
What did your song mean, lady?
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.
Well then, you have good reason to be sad.
Looking just like the dead king.
No, no.
No.
Can’t do it.
Honest, my lord?
Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.
I know she trusts you and tells you everything.
shifts, friends, to Southampton.
My ships will come home a month before the money is due.
You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.
Will you do that for me, Silvius?
In cash.
Amen!
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.
No.
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes.
They’re all ready to eat dinner.
But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me?
I could have saved her.
As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music.
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.
But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.
There’s money in it for you.
Signior Balthasar, you look upset.
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us.
I don’t have it with me.
No, not a penny.
Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.
Listen!
Put
The hell with order!
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.
I am a gentleman of a company.
Have I lost my wit?
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
Madam, Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned.
No, not at all— All right, all right.
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Come, Ariel—I summon you with a thought.
Tell him that when our noble father, the duke of York, gave his three sons his blessing, he never imagined that our friendship would come to this.
I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise.
It’s true I heard a humming sound, a strange one, which woke me up.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
I sent for you about a sad occasion.
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
Good night, good boy.
Oh my, what’s the news?
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock.
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it?
God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it.
But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost.
I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better.
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.
Oh pain!
I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
I’ll 
What mercy can you show him, Antonio?
No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo.
I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam.
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.
Why?
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.
You were born from a woman.
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy.
The clock hasn’t struck yet.
Those are only two of his weapons.
You think I care what I’m called?
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.
But as for this ring, please excuse me.
Look at you, standing there in a stupor!
I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death.
But this is bad!
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours.
Caesar resents me, but he loves Brutus.
There’s no reason to be afraid.
Yes, at Philippi.
We shall, my liege.
And did you leave him like this?
Norfolk, we’re going to have a few blows, right?
I’d be ashamed to give you this.
Tell them to slick down their hair, brush their blue coats, and make sure their socks match.
Musicians, play us a song.—Prince, you look sad.
Shut up, you doddering old wizard!
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention.
No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.
Come, trusty sword.
I leave him to you.
Get that fool out of here.
Unless I am mistaken, Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa, where we both stayed twenty years ago.
I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!
Curse your families!
Why, what is there to do before I get there?
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea.
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women?
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
Go.
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you?
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
A very candid reply.
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.
Well, that doesn’t worry me.
Let’s have the evidence.
You’ve seen these illusions.
Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.
I could not forget you, since I never saw you before in my life.
Friends of this country.
Go tell him about this.
Listen Tranio!
My head is pounding.
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood.
But give words a chance.
I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.
Good Portia, go to bed.
Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn.
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her.
He was not born to be shameful.
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening.
Let me take my chances.
Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.
Come on.
Wait, sweet Beatrice.
What did I do?
True, noble prince.
I took good care of you—piece of filth that you are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter.
Wait for me there.
How are you, sir?
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
She is dead.
If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me.
I’m afraid it will  I’d love it.
Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.
A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef.
Go back again, to be beaten home again?
I had a dream last night.
Unhappy fortune!
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
Fate, do your work.
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house.
In a half an hour he’ll be asleep.
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen?
Please, leave me alone.
If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
For three months.
So will I.
I could really use his advice right now.
Well, that proves she’s in love with you.
Why do you hide these things?
Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns!
Is everything ready for that event?
And she’s loyal, as she has proven.
Why, who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud?
I assure you, sir, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Do you want to know what I wrote?
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs.
I have a pretty good ear for music.
What should I call you when you’re a man?
I won’t refuse you anything.
Go ahead.
His name is Tyrrel, my lord.
No, I don’t, my lord.
No.
We have to strike while the iron’s hot.
Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost.
You’ll work for me.
What color, madam?
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.
Get out of here.
As good a reason as any.
Get out!
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.
Aren’t you Romeo?
I think you’re right, sir.
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.
Bottom!
The world’s a liar.
I always loved you.
Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around.
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools.
That he had sex with you.
No.
Change into better clothes.
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say.
Even if she lives till the end of the world, she’d keep burning an additional week.
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity.
Madam, I will.
Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak.
And now he’s gone.
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
What is the matter?
There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles.
This is a majestic and harmonious vision.
But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
Don’t be offended.
Well, I’m glad about this.
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.
I didn’t see him.
I represent her.
M”—Malvolio.
Both of which, master constable— You have.
Oh, for God’s sake.
What does this say?
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree, with the help of her powerful assistants, and left you there for twelve years.
No, some of it is about my child’s father.
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?
Master, should I watch the door?
I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery.
That’s it!
Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even France or England!
Eighty ducats in one shot!
Oh, they continually urged the king to do it.
Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place.
He’s getting worse and worse.
We’re available.
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
I loved this man so much it makes me weep.
That was a poor unlucky beggar.
I’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom.
You really don’t recognize me, father?
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
And so he fainted.
Take this.
My lord, welcome this man.
Even though half of him is like a 
Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday!
That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
Put on your nightgown.
Well, then he must be alive.
Your death would prevent that.
Lysander, keep your Hermia.
Ensign, what’s he doing in there?
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
Oh, evil, evil!
But truly, if I were as 
Until then, we’ve said enough. 
I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz.
Come with me.
It will be as the gods see fit.
Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time.
Wonderful!
I’m at your service.
Madam!
Did the brothers-in-law leave?
He could never bear carnation.
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive.
That’s a good point.
Go play with yourself.
That counts for everything.
Then what’s Antony?
I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets.
How are you, Lorenzo?
Which troupe is it?
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love.
It is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds.
We’re strangers here.
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on.
Oh, will you leave me alone in the dark?
Oh, well.
Come with me now, and help me out.
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
There’s my hat!
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
It was a good and lucky vision.
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.
That’s true.
Nell.
What does that have to do with my Lysander?
Why did you cry out in your sleep?
How’s it going, Shylock?
Come on, woo me, woo me.
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
I’m not sure, but I don’t think so.
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks.
And I’ve been avoiding him all day.
Come here, man.
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.
Come on, sir, let’s go.
Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.
No, no, they wouldn’t.
Take this!
Help!
I need proof!
I used to love you.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
He  I can’t tell what’s going on.
Let him come in.
Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.
But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.
Try again.
What an annoying man, this guy is!
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?
Are you sad about that?
So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
We will.
Ungodly and monstrous!
I won’t beg the gods to punish you, or caution you to fear their judgment.
Good.
My lord, I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor: the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it.
Goodbye, nymph.
What do you want?
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.
Titinius is lying face-up.
Is this the work of an ambitious man?
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war.
Therefore, tell me, what is he doing at sea?
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
Come on, take us to him.
Don’t trust rotten planks.
How did my master die, Strato?
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever.
And I for no woman.
We’re absolutely not here to delight you.
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
No, my lord.
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind.
He’s as 
You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes.
Is that the latest we can do it?
She shall, Lucentio.
She will be pleased.
Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward.
Yes, my lord.
Jesus, let’s kill him!
Come on, you can go.
But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it?
I’ve worked it out.
Not in my house, Lucentio.
The king rode out alone to view their troops.
I wish them all safe trips home.
My brave relative!
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired!
No, sir, worse off.
He must be very near by now.
No, Messala.
I’m no villain.
We’ll do what you want us to, my lord.
Leave him alone.
I will not do them wrong.
Oh, where’s Romeo?
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
Someone knocks.
And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself.
Where’s Antony?
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
The more I suffer, the more spiteful he becomes.
Well, so-so.
Goodbye.
Then he swore he was a stranger here.
Only you would look for a fight like that.
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home.
But how is it possible that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?
And that Mr. Shore’s wife has nice feet, cherry lips, pretty eyes, and a very pleasant way of expressing herself.
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!
That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.
That’s Claudio.
You can’t trust all the rumors.
He turned away twice and almost left him there.
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth?
Yes, but he’d deny it all.
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
Wake Duncan with your knocking.
Well, your imprisonment won’t last long.
Hooray!
Are you sure of that?
Good duke, come receive your daughter.
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong?
And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus.
Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking.
Ha!
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house.
Come on, put it away.
Hey!
It was worse than being a captive in chains.
I learned to do this from you. 
Well done!
I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
No!
Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you.
What’s this?
Why do people love you?
Not if you go away, there isn’t.
Are you really going to tell me that?
But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say.
Get them in here.  
King Lear, I’ve always honored you as king, loved you as my father, obeyed you as my master, and thanked you in my prayers— I’m furious and ready to snap.
The sky shows countless stars.
That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth, who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old.
You know me too well.
Go on!
Be happy that you’re alive.
Still, I’d hate to see my former dreams return.
My reputation, my reputation!
What is this?
I suspect his friends will join us.
I accept that offer happily, madam.
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway.
Are you scared?
Never a moment of peace!
No.
You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve you forever.
Here’s another jacket to say thanks.
Come, here’s some sauce to go with it.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth.
You kick me out, he kicks me back.
I make the laws, not you.
If you can shape up, you’re welcome to stay in the house.
And I’m going to sleep.
I take all responsibility for my decisions.
I wouldn’t either, by daylight.
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings.
For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend.
Receive all the blessings of a happy father.
I’m sure he’s been kidnapped.
This is a horrible sight.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
No, great king.
Make it a word and a blow.
Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men.
I can read.
What, am I being denied death, as well?
Is the army without a leader?
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
I’ve noticed it myself.
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects.
Tsk, you’re wrong.
Who’s going to keep me from them?
Please let me prove you’re a fool.
He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.
If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined.
Oh, noble Caesar!
Will you go hide?
I’ll do it.
Is that true?
How did we manage to get ashore?
My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.
If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes.
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking?
Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority.
It’s my duty to be quiet.
That’s Cassio’s voice.
Do I look as pale as everyone else does, Lord Dorset?
What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?
Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love?
Little pitchers have big ears.
Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning.
Madam, oh, good Empress!
Oh, let me kiss his hand!
A spirit?
Have her send it to me.
Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy.
We’ll draw straws.
As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan.
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions.
If I’m lying, then
Is that his answer?
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
Indeed, Hero herself can!
I have no power over you.
Oh, come on.
To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it!
Let it go.
Not tonight—today.
You’d better knock louder.
My lord?
Will we hear from you before bedtime, Catesby?
Most noble Caesar!
Relax, gentlemen.
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
Yes, he was.
You call this a scale?
By nine o'clock.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow.
It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.
But go on.
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor-plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran.
Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.
That’s all there is to say.
His ships are maneuverable.
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era.
What a silly monster, to think a poor drunk is wonderful.
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?
We are free from his tyranny.
I’ll go with you.
With her, on top of her—however you want to say it.
What marvelous music!
Then I’ll see you again?
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags, which I’m sure I haven’t, his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army.
Yes, it’s true, sir.
What quality is that, my lord?
She is not, madam.
Well, her name’s a word, and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore.
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.
And let no one suffer for this deed except us, the perpetrators.
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony!
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden.
What’s the matter?
Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.
I’m finished, then.
So go out there and give him what he wants.
Can you hear me?
Welcome.
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
Will it be tonight at supper?
Has any man seen him at the barber’s?
I think I did, sir.
I’ve got the whole barrel, man.
But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation.
Who is it?
He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them.
We three are married, but you two are defeated.
Help!
In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys.
Do you doubt I’ll write?
Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says.
She’s not even fourteen.
Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going.
I will.
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
Why shouldn’t I?
Then see a good one for me.
I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving.
I’m here.
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness.
I will, my lord.
Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?
It won’t matter.
Get away from me, you ass!
He intends to do something bad to you.
It’s over here.
The general is talking to you!
It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought.
My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?
It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.
Nothing.
No, he did not.
Farewell, good Strato.
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.
Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did.
She’s insistent.
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture, I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil.
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
I’ll give  Thank you, darling.
Ariel, go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache, give them muscle cramps all over, and give them more bruises than leopards have spots.
Here’s an empty seat, sir.
Are any ships leaving tonight?
Of course, they won’t believe you without proof.
My lord?
He’s so flighty in his old age, as we keep noticing.
Call Claudio and some of my other men.
If your vengeful heart can’t forgive me, here—take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul, which adores you, can be free.
Are you going to join them?
Where’s Antonio, then?
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature.
My lord, I know what I’m saying.
I will go out.
That must mean a sword.
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
You have ruined my innocent child.
We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings.
Malvolio’s coming down the path.
Take good care of him.
He’s fainted!
Shame on you, warped hag!
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
Yes, and one other place, if you’ll only let me name it.
Won’t King Richard let me speak with him?
Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death!
Then love me, Rosalind.
This place is full of trouble, torments, and amazements.
What was the last cry for?
If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.
Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer!
Well, take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off.
So shut up!
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then.
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting.
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination.
I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore.
Now leave me alone, as I said.
I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.
Is Othello angry?
Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds.
Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it.
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
I don’t know.
Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me.
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
Now my spells are all broken, And the only power I have is my own, Which is very weak.
This play isn’t right for you.
And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.
No, Kate?
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.
It’s time to leave.
What a spoiled little brat.
What do you believe?
Yes, my lord.
Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.
Whenever you like.
I suspect some foul play.
So, what’s the news on the Rialto?
You think I’m kidding.
Go on, take them.
They got what they deserved.
It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir.
I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me.
Yes it is, you half-blood.
We’ll leave, Brutus.
Is Cassius nearby?
Come on, don’t quarrel with us, good old man.
And let us swear to our resolution.
Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease!
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here?
If they have done this thing, my noble lord— If?
After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring.
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon.
With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
My king, they haven’t come back yet.
Go and wiggle your ears!
Where did she die?
Let me see his face.
Why Dover?
I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors.
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine.
Be gone!
I haven’t seen him recently.
But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
A drum, a drum!
The French are still fighting.
I told him you were asleep.
Oh, I thank my lucky stars, I’m so happy.
My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
Help!
You should be whipping yourself, since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her.
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people.
Let them start something.
Has it been so long?
By God!
That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.
That’s completely beside the point.
Tell her to come to me.
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.
Stars, my lord.
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring.
Don’t shed even one tear.
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
But it’s enough.
The king made peace among all of us.
Without doubt I’ve heard that.
Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army.
What do you mean, beside yourself?
That’s not how I do business.
Let me work on him.
We’re ready if our minds are ready.
No wonder she’s waiting to get married.
Enough of this frivolous talk.
Stay!
Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see.
Madam, I heard her speak.
Truthfully, my name is Cinna.
They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.
Goodbye, sir.
My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights!
You’re bothering me.
But she is no virgin.
She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said.
The king wants to speak with Cornwall.
Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets.
If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.
Goodbye.
Very near, my master.
It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes.
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house!
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.
They stared at us in confusion.
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.
It’s impossible.
I’ll follow.
He’s thirty years old.
You think so?
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
Tut, tut, my lord, we’re not going to stand around chit-chatting.
I don’t think you would.
If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.
Let the envoy from Antony come in.
Yes, my lord.
Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave unharmed.
Thank you very much.
Well, well, I don’t care.
Let’s go.
You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower.
What’s keeping you?
Her curses have made my hair stand on end.
I’ve almost missed the time he requested.
Since your woes are only a portion of mine, I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own.
Don’t think about her.
Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!
I sink under the heavy weight of love.
Tell us, Othello.
So we are in agreement.
Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore.
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that?
Let’s go inside.
Leave me quickly.
Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that.
I bet she’ll chew him out.
He got what he deserved.
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
It’s true.
Husband?
We failed in half of our mission.
Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides.
Don’t do this!
I’m too young to remember anything like it.
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was.
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
This repays me.
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.
So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it.
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?
Fight?
Take me to the garden.
He made my heart leap for you.  
Your true demonic features are distorting your body.
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.
Forgotten you!
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
My noble lords and relatives, good morning.
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.
I order you, speak!
And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine.
I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind.
Who’s there, in the other devil’s name?
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say.
Farewell, my lord.
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter.
It’s two o'clock now.
Turn the ship to the wind!
I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love.
I am at your service.
Make yourself comfortable.
No, don’t throw any of it away.
And yet you say that exile is not death?
Ask him in here.
Don’t say anything else.
I’m glad Casca is with us.
It’s almost morning.
Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind, and if you can’t take it, then you’d better plug your ears.
I wish to God that the golden crown that I’ll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain!
There must be some resolution.
Yes, madam, that’s the one.
Do you want to exchange fathers?
Who in the crowd is calling me?
No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one.
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you.
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place.
Who doesn’t know he’s dead?
All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back.
I have drawn my sword.
Let’s discuss it some more.
Please, let’s not talk about it.
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads.
So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated.
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight.
No?
That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name, sir.
Yes, why shouldn’t she?
Sweet Desdemona!
And as king I’ll love you forever.
Should I say to you, “Set them free!
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart.
You did it?
Time travels at different speeds for different people.
Do you want to go see him?
What’s amazing is how long he lasted.
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
Help me, angels!
What, is he dead?
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.
I know him well.
If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work.
And I hope you won’t think badly of me.
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
Let’s carry him in triumph to his house!
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.
If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy.
The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them.
One criminal punishes another.
Swear by my sword.
Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?
Get up and listen to me.
So go on, tell me the news.
What an ass I am.
What is it?
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself?
I am nothing but a poor, used fool.
Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears.
What are you doing here alone?
Won’t he?
Listen!
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping.
You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you.
Yes, sir, we hope so.
No, lovely princess.
For the love of God, help us!
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
Listen a minute.
No, not like before.
And why are you so pale?
How are you, Hamlet?
Let lightning spit fire!
Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him?
I saw him once.
Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully.
A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog.
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
Why did I come here if not for that?
But often in these cases, reports are just estimates.
My dear fool, because my brother died.
I’ll sleep over here.
What, just because they kissed in private?
You’ve lost your resolve.
It’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island.
I wish I could work for that lady!
I know what I’ll do.
Leonato and his brother.
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.
Then stay with us.
The gods are fair, and they use our little vices to punish us.
Please hear what Goneril is saying.
Please take them.
Go to him, petition him.
What will we say is our excuse for being here?
Come on.
Let’s do that.
Do you want to know who they are, then?
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed.
Tear him to pieces.
Sport?
Here comes Antony.
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.
Here comes the noble Antony.
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, and you, Sir Walter Herbert, are going to stay with me.
And I too?
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack!
Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
I’m coming, slut!
Well, then, there!
Most formidable Queen!
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
What an idiot that monster is!
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.
I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.
You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.
Give me your hand.
Prison, my lord?
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too.
I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.
I’ll never see it.
I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat.
Come here, boy.
But not a member of the royal family, like me.
Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi.
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty.
Look, here he comes.
Be patient, because you’re staying with me.
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you?
Oh, really?
Start a fight?
Look out, here she comes.
Be pointed and brief.
What did he do that made him flee this land?
Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed.
Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it.
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?
Yes.
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger.
You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban.
Night is approaching.
If that’s true, I think the same thing about you.
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
That day will never come.
Go ahead, Moon.
How are you doing, brother?
Come, then, and send his body to Thasos.
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.
That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite?
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.
His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier.
You call yourself my wife, yet you don’t call me “husband”?
Anyway, what should we do?
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.
Who are you?
Come on, let’s get to the banquet.
I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding.
Please go to him, my friend.
They don’t want you to go out today.
What do you want from me?
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him.
Let’s go greet him when he lands.
What’s the play called?
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
And smelled like that, too?
I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders.
If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over.
Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor?
Just remember that he is Caesar.
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady?
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell.
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner.
Indeed?
Dead.
Name him.
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell vat is  To kiss.
Teach me to forget to think!
I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold.
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings.
That’s what I hear.
I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh.
We might as well call him a man, since God created him.
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
Don’t take Helena’s side.
Yes, monstrous, monstrous!
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?
Go get me a crow.
Why, dear me, Kate!
If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters.
Come, husband, let’s go to lunch.
I’ll take you to where he sleeps, and you can pound a nail into his head.
But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little.
If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir?
If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time.
With all my heart, Phoebe.
Don’t forget the vows we made to each other.
I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.
Gentle boy, good night.
For God’s sake, my lord, let’s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince.
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey.
He’s in Athens, my lord.
What do you wish?
And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you?
I can’t live by pretending anymore.
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
What symptoms, my lord?
It’s a job meant for a man, but not you.
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
Hold your tongue.
Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan.
Welcome to Cyprus.
I swam ashore like a duck.
Speak to us.
Pray well, father.
Go.
Who is this fool?
She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.
Let fortune and victory be yours!
What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?
Ratcliffe, come here.
No, follow him now, before he divulges the prank and ruins everything.
What!
Not me.
Good friends, go in and have some wine with me.
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord.
In a king, the sight is unbearable.
If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.
If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped.
When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me.
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
If Echo were as fast, he would be worth a dozen like Belman.
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly.
My Cesario?
Great Duke, be merciful to mortal men.
Not until you pass out.
I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity.
I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria.
Hunting what, Curio?
Let’s get away, Tybalt.
What a righteous judge!
Oh painful sympathy!
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are!
Get lost, will you?
Please go away, both of you.
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands.
Where did you die?
Great Queen Juno is coming.
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight.
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.
Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day.
Go as fast as you can.
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife.
What does my powerful master wish for?
Have a good life.
Do we have devils on the island?
A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting.
Come, take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton.
Yes, I am.
All this”?
Yes.
We’ll burn Brutus’s house.
Where is my page?
I don’t think so!
Weren’t we both born under Taurus?
I haven’t seen him for two days.
Most mighty sovereign, you have no reason to doubt my friendship.
Let the gods judge me!
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart?
What can I tell you?
Have you forgotten her?
The more I pray, the less I get out of it.
No, he has only a little beard.
No.
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him!
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
They’re ready whenever you are.
What, he never made you laugh?
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
My dear madam, why are you in mourning?
Don’t worry about the consequences.
Your mistress is a good mount.
I’m begging you.
The police are here.
Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the 
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.
But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration.
Why, dear child?
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away.
We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.    
In God’s name, speak.
I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me.
They’ll kill us!
Oh, I remember that very clearly!
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king.
There’s nothing to get upset about.
Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long!
Horny animals!
Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance.
Why so pale, my friend?
Then go gather your men, but leave behind your son, George Stanley.
If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown.
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.
Taurus!
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!
The Lord keep him from the title of king!
Is that you, Diomedes?
But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray?
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.
Did God make him?
May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine.
Have you heard something of her in your letters?
I’ll fight at sea.
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him.
Madam!
And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath.
It’s him, it’s him.
What do you have to tell me?
Why, the one I just told you about.
There’s no crab-apple here, so don’t look sour.
If I find an opportunity, I will give him a piece of my mind.
You speak more wisely than you know.
Good-bye, good Queen.
Why should men be more free than women?
The world’s huge.
Knock, knock!
Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.
Do you have anything else to tell me?
You’ll get a blow from me for that, I think.
I’ll leave you now.
It’s new to you.
It’s true, my lord.
I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me.
Hush, Hortensio.
Then lead the way, father.
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
The moon has set.
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?
I swear by this hand that I love you.
Why are you leaving, my angry friend?
Look how your servants wait on you, each one ready to do whatever you command.
You were one of his favorites.
That would be a little extreme!
You have my consent.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
Damn it!
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
So what’s going on?
Never, my lord.
I gave him the material.
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me.
Why, Fool?
Have the excavators stopped work?
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.
You and your servant are very funny, sir.
Or did you agree to this as equals?
You told me you hated him.
I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I’m dying to have.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
Let me shake your hand.
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English!
How do you feel?
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to— Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius, cheer up.
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.
Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice.
Oh, it’s too terrible.
Let him be for a bit.
The hell with her!
Well, lead on.
Why not?
No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights.
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up.
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter.
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins.
Enough, enough.
Well, other men have bad luck too.
Yes, with Cassio.
Thank you, brave Cassio.
Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.
Fast!
You should get a wife!
Come away with me.
I tell you, I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing.—Go on, bite.
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?
Where’s Peaseblossom?
Here is the money.
I, fight against you, Antony?
No ship could survive this storm.
It is my rival for Bianca.
Just to the Tower—I’m guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.
Come with me.
Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.
Don’t you know me still?
I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke.
I don’t believe it.
I’d rather kill myself.
Then I guess the whole world is one.
By my father’s death— Your life has dishonored his death.
I have a list of all the important men.
Error in the bill, sir, error in the bill!
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius.
They wouldn’t say anything?
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door.
What time is it?
Good day, Catesby.
Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers.
Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left.
I’ll hide and listen in.
God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it.
An Englishman?
Now you’re talking.
Quick, quick.
Do it well, and then leave us.
What did you say to me?
It’s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell, a joke, a prank, a doll’s cap.
Goodbye.
But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you!
To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity.
I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too.
We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he.
Signior Benedick!
Don’t be crass.—You all look confused.
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again.
He has epilepsy, a disease where you fall down.
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles.
What support did we have besides our father?
Calphurnia!
I’m finished.
Let them last forever.
This harms my reputation.
Who are the new commissioners?
Stay and tell me more.
Your royal father is murdered.
Yes, my good lord.
She’s dead, my Queen.
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all.
Welcome, good Robin.
Where is kind Hastings?
There is much to be learned from these converts. 
Madam!
I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.
I will pause for a reply.
That part of his reputation will stand.
It won’t go on.
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing.
Where is that moron of a cook?
Come on, shovel.
What’s the bet?
Yes, good idea; that’s the 
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three.
The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.
His beard was gray, right?
I’m sorry, you were saying?
Then I’ll tell you.
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.
But I’ll tell you something from my soul.
What do you think of this plan?
Let’s put our heads together.
Meet me in a little while at the citadel.
Your grace, please forgive me.
Curse my father’s ambition!
On my knee, I humbly ask your blessing.
No, let’s not swear an oath.
Come, Grey.
Where’s the cook?
Tell me where you live.
It doesn’t matter.
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.
You sing, and I’ll dance.
Not at all!
I won’t tolerate him.
Pompey has a strong navy.
You don’t know that?
Nice Grumio, bring me some.
There, Leonato, take your daughter back.
I’ll look over the inscriptions again.
Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house.
Talk to him.
Death is my heir.
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
He really plays well.
Tell me.
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
Where’s lady Portia?
Too bad it fell flat.
Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature?
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.
He is in love with Hero.
She’s dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.
Freedom!
I find you quite gentle.
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
Either here or at the Capitol.
But I’m sure he’ll get even with you.
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us.
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love.
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
Say what you’re here for.
And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle.
It’s too much.
There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch.
You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing.
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
I have already condemned and excused myself.
How old are you, friend?
What do you have to say to me?
Sir Topas!
I’ve only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law.
Here are my keys.—But why should I go?
But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil.
Forget about him, Jack!
Your Grace can do whatever he wants.
He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her?
How amazing!
Many people have told me so.
I came here crying.
What’s this?
He won’t get the better of me.
We have a little dessert coming up. 
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone.
Now they work for me.
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well. 
Listen, Fairy King.
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings.
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight.
Gave me, sir?
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe.
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind.
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine.
Say something again.
Come on, relax, dear.
Here comes my lady.
Do you want to hear it again?
My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you.
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
I think it’s later than that, sir.
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company.
I couldn’t stay behind after you left.
What do I see here?
Where’s this so-called king?
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me.
Read it, Mark Antony.
Hortensio 
I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
I’ll put up my shield and battle you.
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.
Treat them with honor and dignity.
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear.
He plans to leave tomorrow.
But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him.
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her.
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
If you wish.
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms.
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?
I wish you’d be patient.
No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it.
You said she slept with Cassio.
He’s conducting some business with my lady, and sooner or later he’ll leave.
There was a noise, that’s certainly true.
Duke of Burgundy, if you want peace, the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe, you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands.
This is Trebonius.
And you won’t until the needy eat.
Well, I’m sorry for your niece.
Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.
Can someone fall in love this quickly?
It’s—But he’s drowned, and these guys are devils.
That’s good, my boy.
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.
Like her?
Well, if you have to go, you have to go.
Hitting his wife?
If we do, it’ll drive us crazy.
Send him on his way quickly.
Is that Barnardo?
Oh, liars can look so honest!
Hang on a second.
Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready.
God in heaven bless her!
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.
Iago.
Did you hear that?
Sweet Sir Andrew!
There’d be no marriage?
If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it.
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
Never!
Well, let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind.
Yes, boy, I’m ready.
I hate it and want all good men’s love.
I don’t have that kind of reputation!
But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell.
Oh, sir, pardon me!
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully.
I will, sir.
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?
My father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.
That her father’s brother wants to be her husband?
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
If not, then I’m a liar.
Who’s calling?
I know him well by reputation.
I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies.
Let’s drink through midnight.
Come on, my lord.
I think so.
Good-bye!
Whatever you are, thanks for your advice.
Come here, Catesby.
Noble people don’t answer to peasants!
This is going even better than I planned.
You’ve said what you have to say now.
To which we all appeal.
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring.
The other girl did not love me.
I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals?
I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil.
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
What do you mean by “furniture”?
Look, here comes Helena.
Some water will fix that.
There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other.
Please, keep it to yourself.
Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed.
Yes, they are.
You’ve never seen anything like it.
You’ll fight with him eventually, and  The duke, my father, loved his father very much.
What kind of scheme do you have going together?
Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.
I say my prayers out loud.
They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing.
I promise.
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?
It’ll go away.
The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are.
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?
Everything’s ready.
And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.
What should we do about that?
Who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country?
It’s going to be fun, I promise.
Some people kiss shadows.
More, more, please, more.
Stay right here and try to look good.
What’s your message?
Never mind.
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
Take out your sword and come on.
Is her voice pitched high or low?
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword.
Yes, my good lord.
Transform your grief into anger.
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest; tomorrow we’ll march on.
Forgive me.
So prepare to die.
As I came down?
Absolutely—so long as he gets the girl.
We all must die, Messala.
And now you know my meaning.
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
No doubt, no doubt.
They’re louder than the storm or us sailors.
I have nothing to say to you.
Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms.
I have news, ma'am.
You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?
We can’t think that way about what we did.
I could be convinced if I were like you.
I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for
Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before.
You were worn with honor. 
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you.
Go to your tomb!
Then run away.
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us, we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious, causing him to chase us when he never intended to.
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order.
My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer.
Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.
The ground is bloody.
Do you hear what I say, lady?
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason.
It’s not in the contract.
And I’ll tell him about the letter too.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.
He’s got an answer for everything.
Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded.
Good-bye, my lord.
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
But I’m as noble as my opponent.
I mean what I say.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
Should we go see the sights in the town?
Yes, my good lord.
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise, I guess.
Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here.
We used to think so too.
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness.
Where are you, Pindarus?
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
Here, sir, as foolish as ever.
To be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning, when your future will be decided.
It’s too bad.
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on.
Who’s that?
Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed.
It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!
No, that’s not true.
It must go like this.
Stop!
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.
Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.
Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing?
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
The battle on the sea is almost lost.
No, it wasn’t.
Really, I’ll help.
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better.
Let’s go!
In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be.
Everything you told me I already knew.
You’d better go inside.
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food.
Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes.
This means I’ve mistreated Edgar.
You’re standing.
It is.
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
She’ll be damned for it.
I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this.
I pardon that man.
Damn it!
Now I must return to the wedding.
He carries a third of the world.
I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
Oh, most bloody sight!
She says that you should come to her.
Listen, Hortensio.
With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours.
There’s other work for you to do.
My brother is in heaven.
My God, what a great song!
Honest, yes, honest.
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!
Didn’t I?
No one except her maid and a holy hermit.
It is.
Oh, Tranio, until it happened to me, I never would have thought it possible.
I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again.
He once said the devil would get him because of women.
I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight.
Very soon, because you want it.
Noses, ears, lips.
I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back.
And I have much less to comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my daughter.
Call the numbskull back in here.
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?
Goodbye, then.
But who is this?
My noble lord— What is it, Iago?
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down?
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
Oh, gods, make me worthy of this noble wife!
Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow.
What are these things we’re looking at, my lord Antonio?
Oh Stephano, do you have any more of that wine?
Then be so kind as to show them in.
Make me believe it?
In a minute, sir.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
Alas, you don’t know.
Is he there in person?
What do you mean, do I think so?
They fled toward Peloponnesus.
The more I love him, the more he hates me.
Isn’t that the king?
How do you know he loves her?
Tie up his withered old arms.
I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point.
Well, I’ll get my revenge.
Or walk either.
Have a seat.
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
How can it be?
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
Who’s that coming over here?
Dearest Olivia— What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please— My lord wants to speak.
Get out of here, my friend.
Just say it.
The only glory princes have are their titles.
It’s my daughter!
Go!
Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!
Look, he’s recovering.
May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool!
I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them!
Tell me.
Use your clubs and spears!
Here’s mine.
You said it right, old mole.
Take your time.
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king.
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.
There’s a fool sharing my bed now.
Here are forty ducats.
And let me kill Cassio.
Or is he on his horse?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
It’s another Hero!
Two of both kinds makes four.
Give him a noose to hang himself.
Wake up the Montagues.
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax, my mother.
What, faithful to being mean and nasty?
I’m so sorry.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar.
And in the morning I’ll take you to your ship and we’ll sail to Naples, where I hope to see this loving couple married.
I’m telling you the truth.
But let me place this wreath on your head.
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks.
And my sweet master, I received no gold.
But aren’t you drowned, Stephano?
You’re a king’s advisor.
What is fated to happen must happen.
Did he lose his other eye?
If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home.
Where else would she be?
Two reasons.
Those who rush stumble and fall.
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance.
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
I’m growing a beard.
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style.
If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.
Oh, lovely.
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
What kind of woman is she?
Go, lad, and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for.
You lie.
You are my other self, my oracle, my prophet, my dear brother!
That’s true.
Then sure ones.
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.
Me, sir?
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away.
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
Farewell.
She was utterly true to you!
Therefore, tremble with fear and leave.
I’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen, once again.
But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
He didn’t know how to stop it.
We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us.
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.
Your scolding is somewhat overblown.
Goodbye, sir.
Oh!
Life’s better at 
How did you know what happened to your poor father?
You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge.
Signor Antonio?
Oh yes, you spoke, my lord, but total nonsense.
No, come on, don’t make me play a woman.
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever.
The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.
Get out of my sight!—Dear Cesario, please don’t be offended.—Get out of here, you barbarian!
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what?
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
What are you doing, old man?
But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar.
So why does it seem so particular to you?
Can’t he pay back the money?
If I know nothing about pity, that must mean I’m not an animal.
To hell with this idiot!
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes.
What’s the prize?
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
We have to take the king’s side.
It may be, it certainly may be.
Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!
Dissolute lowlife, you shall die.
Oh, you’re wrong.
How many wonderful creatures there are here!
Everything may still be all right.
Think about it carefully.
Absolutely.
I’m telling you to make a fist and pound.
That’s a step in the direction of love.
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.
Take it, brave York.
Thank the lord for alliances!
Go, Sir Andrew.
He can’t speak, my lord.
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
What’s done is done.
Liar and slave!
Madam, please let me see your face.
I swear, I don’t like the look of you.
Why are you so pale?
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late. 
I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.
Which two crowns would those be?
Think like that, and you’ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself.
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling?
Should I strike it with my spear?
We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one.
If they do this, as they will, God willing, my ransom will soon be raised.
All right, then.
I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio.
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours.
I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.
I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus. 
Do you have the flower?
Ma'am, my master’s coming.
Tonight is for celebrating!
Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook?
We’ll see you tomorrow.
Most noble man, will you die?
Shall we get started?
But then he said strange things to me.
But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
You lie.
That was a humorous message.
No, I’ve had my say.
You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood.
I heard someone say that’s what it means.
I hope she keeps it short.
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it.
Seriously, though, son Petruchio, I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all.
Now get on with your story.
What is it, my dear Bianca?
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
Don’t wake her.
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
We still have hope. 
Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me.
Oh, this is terrible!
That’s the way to do it!
It’s time for me to go.
So long.
It’s driven me crazy.
A wise man and a fool.
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country.
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair?
It’s almost four.
What’s that?
Now please go.
Lights, lights, get us some lights!
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.
I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet
Pick up this rope ladder.
And buried, noble Tyrrel?
Did you talk with this woman?
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead.
Give me my fishing rod.
Death is my son-in-law.
Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit?
Oh, this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever.
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.
Welcome to the open air again.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.
It’s Richard who sent us here to slaughter you.
They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother.
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by.
Yes, Petruchio.
Quiet there!
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?
So let her execute me.
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing.
It seems not.
If it’s that important, then let the women die.
Excuse me, sir.— Tom’s chilly.
Is your master coming?
In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him.
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself.
But what’s the joke?
Look in the almanac.
Here’s the water, right?
I will.
Now he’s telling the story.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Gentlemen, are you good Christians, and do you serve God?
She only appears honorable from the outside.
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time.
Let’s go to him.
Let’s follow them.
Let’s go.
Get up, liar.
I changed my mind.
I have no doubt that you love me.
They’re certainly a peaceful couple!
Excellent, good.
Answer me.
My legs may be yellow, but I don’t feel blue.
Oh well.
Well, what do you guess?
By God, I’ll go after him again and beat him up.
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.
We will, my noble lord.
I’m not scared of you.
Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves.
It eases the spirit.
If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me.
When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us.
I’ll come soon.
Truly, no—no more than is reasonable.
Who’s there?
You’re trying to trick me, my lord.
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.
Nothing.
That’s old news.
I’ll chop her into pieces.
There are only friends here.
I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery).
She always has to have a light next to her.
But will it be soon?
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.
Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things.
Who was that?
Whom should I knock?
There go the minstrels.
But if the cause is not just, the king himself will have a lot to answer for, when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying, “We died at such and such a place.” Some will be swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some for the wives that are destitute without them, some about the debts they owed, some for their children left unprovided for.
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother.
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.
What would you like to see?
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.
I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human.
We’re three of them.
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
Yes, my good lord.
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.
Hurry now, get the job done.
I heard the galloping of horses.
Good old knight, gather them all together at my tent.
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
That’s what he said.
Please do.
By Hercules, I think I’m right.
The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men.
Do you have desires?
And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.
He does nothing but frown, as if he wants to say, “If you don’t want me, I don’t care.” He doesn’t even smile when he hears funny stories.
If he seems game to our plan, encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons.
No, really, I’m not.
Look, if you love me, stay.
What’s the name of this forest behind us?
And that’s what you want me to do!
As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require.
You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead.
But let me see, by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen.
I wish I knew what is happening.
Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns.
It’s true.
You need not kneel to me.
The gods forbid!
Helena, it’s not true.
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last.
Me too, Lord!    
Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?
Let me choose now.
Where’s Romeo?
Yes, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
I hope not, Madam.
Cassius, don’t take it badly.
He doesn’t have to care.
Oh!
I did.
Good.
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
I am willing to fight you if I must.
What, the necklace?
If I told you I understood Greek, I’d be lying.
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?
But not so nice when women misbehave.
Go, get out of here.
Goddammit!
What do the priests say?
Hey out there!
I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund.
I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt.
His horse is killed, so he’s fighting on foot, risking his life to search out Richmond.
I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this.
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too!
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.
Oh, you idiot!
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!
What could you possibly ask for?
Some kind of fountain?
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island.
How is lieutenant Cassio?
Look how far that little candle sends its light!
What have you two sisters done?
I could imagine he’s divine, since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before.
You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
And all my children?
Let them judge us however they please.
Don’t be late.
You’ll be pricked all over, and it’ll sting like bees.
Go ahead.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
Lucentio!
Not for a second.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear        My protector, Richard, insists on it.
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy?
Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above.
You are the best of the cutthroats.
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
I’ll change that name for you.
So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head.
Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping.
If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly.
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
I will not take it.
Don’t take my love for granted.
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.
Hurry.
I’ll give it to him.
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.
Will you marry her?
What’s that good for?
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
No man must know.” What if this someone were you, Malvolio?
With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.
Hey!
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome.
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Was that him just now?
Goodbye.
Yes, sir, they’re ready.
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.
I pulled it from his wound.
I don’t know.
You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls.
All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime.
Pardon us, dear father.
When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.
Gone?
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed.
And when I’m king, remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it, which my brother the king used to own.
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.
You, my slave, were her servant at the time, as you admit yourself.
Damn it, you’re not listening to me!
Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good conscience.
Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy.
I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself.
And that’s how she died?
When they choose, they only know how to lose.
Yes Signior?
Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.
The foul plan backfired on me.
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him.
He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one.
Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you.
I’m telling you, it’s not lost.
As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did.
Oh, that’s with worry.
You’re a smart guy.
Neither?
Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London.
God and your work be praised, victorious friends.
But major issues must come before minor ones.
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty.
The devil must be behind this.
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
Not at all, Touchstone.
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
That’s enough.
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.
What are you doing here?
He’s standing ready outside the door.
Is the king dead, the empire dispossessed?
Where are you going?
Your mother’s been poisoned.
On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things about her lover, and he forgave her.
I’ll be vain and proud, I’ll read up on politics, I’ll insult Sir Toby, I’ll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I’ll be the perfect man for her.
Come sit on me.
Off with his son George’s head!
Your grave is gaping open, and your death is near.
Come here, you.
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news.
Wait, and listen to me, countrymen.
But with you it’s different.
Not offensive at all.
How nice of you!
Look over your lines again.
A crazy bastard.
Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick.
I can tell that you don’t know who I am.
Yes, it truly is.
Madam, he’s well.
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me?
No, it hasn’t, my lord.
I bet she’s fast asleep.
Hortensio, what’s all this about?
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Were you listening to these verses?
I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute.
When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
Oh, dear gods!
How can you top that?
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts.
No, you’ll have to excuse me.
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death.
A rotten, foolish monster.
Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you!
Good luck.
Are you my son?
Go back with her?
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered.
Who’s coming here?
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.
Hail, Caesar!
Go and put on your own armor.
Quiet!
The letters he spoke of may help me.
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.
Don’t be silly!
Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you!
And even then, in order for me to catch the fly your cousin, she must be blind?
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.
I didn’t love you.
It stands by her bedside.
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.
Who’s sounding that alarm?
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
A crow without feathers?
Stop her!
Shame on you, you slanderer!
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies.
He’s a stylish man.
Ranting and raving to my own shadow!
Your Clarence, who stabbed my Edward, is also dead.
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Farewell, everyone.
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.
This is going to be great!
Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness—which, judging from his appearance, he has—he is no fool for love, as you pretend.
Tell me.
Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow.
I don’t feel like going.
Oh, my son, my son!
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.
Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end.
Lovers, it’s time to go to bed.
They’ve turned me into food for worms.
Can we finish our lunch?
Treason!
I don’t even know you.
Oh, that splendid Caesar!
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?
He’ll release him.
Well, then, help me.
Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles.
How unbelievable!
How can they refuse to speak with me?
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this.
If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!
Calm down.
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way.
Awake, my lords!
Well, my friends, you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies, they’d have no choice but to execute us.
Forever and a day.
What’s wrong, cousin?
Where are you taking me?
I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this.
Hurry, hurry!
Not one, my lord.
Friar!
The captain—give it to the captain.
For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself.
But even so, I’ll make doubly sure.
He looks calmer than he did before.
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Where are they?
My God!
The same thing.
Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened.
I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
I did, kind lady.
But why did you tempt the heavens like that?
It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back.
But if I shake it up a little it’ll work, because every one of those letters is in my name.
Quiet!
I’ll go hunting again tomorrow, I think.
Help, help, help!
Am I to be dictated to, like a child?
Yes, I have great cause to be thankful.
No.
The gods can hear you lying!
So what do you say to my suit?
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.
What handkerchief?
I’m sorry I hit you.
No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge.
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.
It is.
What do you mean by that?
Have them come in front of the master constable.
He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son.
How old is she?
I’m starting to lose my mind.
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly.
So be it.
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. 
It’s arranged.
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.
Someone adored me once, too.
You horrid slave, you can’t be trained to be good, and you’re capable of anything evil!
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
I don’t like your faults.
I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor.
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.
Take your penalty.
Sir, Octavius has already arrived in Rome.
Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better.
It must be something I did accidentally.
It’s true, they’re inconsistent.
If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny, Then turn to where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.”
I will leave here for Verona tonight.
I see you’ve met with the jeweler.
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you.
And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
We’ll see, won’t we?
Sir, enter the castle.
She was here just now.
Is he dead?
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.
We only drink toasts to my niece.
What did you mean by not helping me?
Let me unbutton this.
The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.
Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me.
But come on, let’s see you do your dance.
I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.
Signor Bassanio!
They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.
And you called the fairy creature harmless, monster.
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
of patience.
That’s merciful but a bit careless.
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.
The things men do daily, not knowing what they’re doing!
This is good.
You have to come with me.
Since you left, I’ve been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I’ve ever had, my lords.
If you sink, you’re dragging love down.
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
When Caesar says “do this,” it is done.
Don’t you know that I’m a woman?
I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.
That’s comforting.
Well, I disagree.
I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort.
I remember he’s already occupied.
Madam, please be patient.
Get me a surgeon!
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
I admit two sleeves.
So you’ll go to hell?
No offense taken.
In heaven.
My mistress,” I said.
Look, look!
A man named Taurus, they say.
Let’s not talk about it.
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy.
A thing of no importance.
Canidius, take our nineteen 
Go, lad, and take them to the pantry.
That’s a nasty garter belt.
Where, good Miss Mary?
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.
Won’t the dawn come from here?
My uncle Clarence’s angry ghost.
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse.
I need to get away from you.
When did I ever do you any harm?
I can’t blame you, old lord.
Is it a habit of his?
I can’t love him.
He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe!
Is it true that good King Edward has died?
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor.
Just listen to him.
Caesar, I will.
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul.
When has anyone ever put you down like that.
Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.
Didn’t you call him a liar?
Good luck, sir.
The fool will stay.
But where is Kate?
Spirit, we have to get ready to meet with Caliban.
It looks like these witches are scared of swords.
That’s very sensible, but you missed my sense: I meant Hortensio is afraid of you.
She has disarmed me.
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
Oh, not you again.
Even  What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me?
Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity.
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city.
I will go straight to visit him.
It’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.
If they seek battle with us, have them come down or else clear the field.
Away with the doddering fool!
My brother Gloucester’s voice?
Yes, I’ll go.
Oh, correct it completely.
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness.
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey.
If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that.
Hey, look over there!
Ah, all you up in heaven!
Do you know them?
That upsets me much more than getting wet.
Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.
I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood.
Well, for your good looks, sir, thank God and don’t boast about it.
He’s made me a Christian.
There’s hardly a bush for miles around.
Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house.
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.
Here he comes.
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along.
If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.
Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me.
He was my brother’s son!
Are you blushing?
Go back with her?
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
What an idiotic place this world is.
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
You’re wrong about that, I assure you.
I swear I do.
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne, my wife, is very sick.
No, he just smiles.
Yes, right away.
Here’s something good.
She will not come.
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy.
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life.
What do you want with me?
So the lion disappeared.
I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife.
Well, you’re not on target there.
What didn’t you like?
Who’s coming?
Be a careful mother, madam, and think about your son, the young prince.
It’s undeniable.
That’ll happen soon enough.
True.
My services are at your command.
I saw the handkerchief.
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly.
I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.
Let’s all sink with the king.
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
Quiet there!
With this in mind, speak, my lord.
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit.
I’ll vouch for that.
It’s come again.
You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?
Oh, he’s a gallant king!
Did you fall?
All the rumors have been confirmed.
Your heart’s going to break.
Oh, fine.
Oh, what a relief!
The devil’s advice is nicer.
So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.
It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them.
We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.
No, by no means.
I am the duke who loved your father.
So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes.
It’s unbelievable.
You wanted to be king of the island, sir?
I have it ready for you.
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.
As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother.
But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.
Write to him immediately.
Do you know Fluellen?
Oh, that’s ominous!
Goodbye!
Bring your master home.
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries?
What are your names?
Oh, if it turns out to be true that he survived, then that storm was kind, and the ocean was full of love!
No, my lord.
My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming.
It’s not true because she separates us.
And here’s my mistress, Titania.
How did he get such an idea?
Excuse me, sir, do you know anything about this?
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again.
Like an invitation.
I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us.
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command.
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.
Therefore, drink up.—Servant-monster, drink a toast to me.
Do as I told you.
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt.
I wish you were what I wanted you to be!
Rust inside my body and let me die.
What’s up, daughter and niece?
Now you sound like a man.
But listen, Charmian.
Put a candle in my study, Lucius.
Now, on my life, the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes, whom she adores.
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie.
Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man.
Now it’s time to get back to my studying, since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner.
I don’t trust you.
Well, it doesn’t matter.
No sir, trust me, I do not.
Leave you alone!
She has a low-pitched voice.
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved.
Your name’s Gloucester.
Cesario, come here.
I won’t say a word.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
Everything’s fine.
What’s going on, my love?
Do as I asked you.
I hope this play is well cast now.
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.
Cram your good news into my ears.
But I don’t get it—what’s the joke?
I don’t care.
You may change your mind later.
I’m sure you both remember me.
Come help me bless this couple, so they will be prosperous and have many children.
Why only a few courtiers, my lord of Buckingham?
When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them.
You’re naughty.
Come with me.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
You bastard workhorse drudge!
Be convincing.
Oh, what a villain!
Please, all of you, stand up.
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?
Amen to that, lady.
Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived.
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish.
Go!
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me.
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed.
It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them.
Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle.
What kind of work is this, Charmian?
Go and get our stuff onto the ship.
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Is there more news?
You will be an accessory to both crimes.
Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness.
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.
He sleeps all day like a cat.
That’s the truth, sir.
If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me.
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this?
He’s going to look like a total idiot.
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.
My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
Am I really like one of those guys?
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations.
I’m coming.
Did you leave on good terms?
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep?
Speak up and tell me!
But you’re no such man.
As a favor to  Nope.
Silly babbler, how you talk!
So you got what you deserved, and were locked up in this cave, which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be.
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
Goodbye, cousin.
Remember to see me today.
Good-bye, until you return tonight.
Who heard me do that?
Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.
I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.
What’s Pyramus?
I just speak directly.
Take them away.
They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots.
No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late.
Tell me, Captain Macmorris, have you left the tunnels?
What’s your business?
My mind is too great for that.
Madam wife, they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years.
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone.
Let me go with you.
I have a daughter.
These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.
Give me your blessing.
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him.
The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.
I must join the duke for lunch.
Well, I won’t take it any longer.
Gentlemen, calm down.
We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions.
I fear that your words and your heart are both false.
Thank you, my noble lord.
You’re right.
I need to hear the truth about all this.
He’s not jealous?
It’s nine o'clock!
Let me go, I say.
I am.
What’s your name?
What’s up, Grumio?
Mercy, mercy!
I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
I wish it were over.
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
You are, but you don’t know it yet.
Come on, what would you say about me?
Bad friends were.
Please, just wait a minute.
Stand aside, Captain Gower.
Delighted to stay?
Is he talking nonsense?
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.
Excellent.
It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well.
In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms.
I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge.
Neighbors, hello.
Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back.
Oh Ratcliffe, I had a terrifying dream!
We’ll take care of it.
Who’s there?
Where are you coming from?
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.
I asked a servant.
What’s he talking about?
He and his daughter are captured.
No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you.
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
Oh God, I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples, as king and queen!
What if your husband strays elsewhere?
Now he won’t give me either.
Don’t simply hide your hatred.
The brave experience death only once.
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
What are you doing, Caesar?
It was probably just a rumor.
We say the king is wise and good, and his noble queen is getting old, pretty, and not jealous.
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes.
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.
Let it fly out.
Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
Reborn.
Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true.
I’m not talking with you.
Thank you.
Why, what a complicated case this is!
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
Leap and dance for him.
Tomorrow, my lord.
But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
Let me shake your hand.
Raise all the money you can.
Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors. 
I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all.
Yes, I truly think He did great good.
Let’s proceed.
At my house.
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
Now, now, both of you gentlemen!
Because my name is George.
Why are you telling me this?
Good morning, Benedick.
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
I say he shall go to prison.
Pick me up.
If you fight to protect your wives, your wives will welcome you home as conquerors.
This fight will decide who dies.
Show us the way.
The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too.
That’s you, right?
Or like a whale.
Knock, knock, knock!
This is a nasty night to go swimming.
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.
It sure is.
I think someone’s coming from Venice.
And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio.
I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me.
What is she saying, my lord?
Oh, good, a knife!
It’s my exercise time.
Quiet!
No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love.
You might just as well say, “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion.” Yes, exactly.
I need a doctor.
You have the power to fix it.
You’re on.
My meaning  And I 
He likes me, and I’ve given him good reason to.
I’ll bet you a hundred marks, my Kate puts her flat on her back.
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
What you were afraid of has happened.
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him?
You will always be welcome to me. 
Where is Polonius?
This news will comfort Cassius.
Your name is Lucentio, you say.
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
Aren’t you Lady Olivia’s fool?
They’re all welcome.
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!
Damn it!
Give me your hand.
The gods do this to test my bravery.
fast and pray to stave off temptations.
But you can make it up to me.
The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.
Well, that’s just greedy.
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.
Do you know him?
Are you always so funny?
If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors.
Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours?
No, my lord.
I do too, my lord.
Indeed, my lord, he is a perfectly wonderful horse.
She was a hellcat in school.
Hey, lady!
My mind is confused.
Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends!
Treat me well.
Ah, my poor princes!
Don’t I deserve more than this?
Give me your blessing.
Please tell me seriously what you think of her.
What’s the news?
What’s important is to be prepared.
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on.
Halt!
Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
What three things does drink make a man do?
With no more ceremony than that?
I swear, it must be thirty years.
Good monster!
To bed!
Oh, please, Prince Dauphin!
So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
Goodbye, good sir.
It’s not manly.
For when you cut your shin.
Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
I’m tired of this moon.
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation.
A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty.
I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.
Contagious infection of humanity, give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you’ve committed.
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely?
Does anyone here know who I am?
He wouldn’t say that.
Are we all here?
Now I must go to the tomb alone.
May God in heaven bless you.
That woman who claims I am her husband—I loathe her in my soul.
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
Yes, that’s true.
Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage?
You’re both wrong.
It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!
Come here, Ariel.
A bit of a hurry, my lord!
If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
It’s true.
You’re a good judge of horsemanship.
I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing!
How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew?
If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf.
This dream has been interpreted all wrong.
You’re wrong, sir, I do care about something.
Try to get him to do that.
Didn’t you talk to it?
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard?
This island belongs to me because Sycorax, my mother, left it to me.
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
Farewell.
You unwashed farmworker!
Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.
No flattery for him, no sir!
What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing?
Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day.
Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester.
But don’t go.
Dead, dead?
You don’t know a thing!
break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps.
What’s the matter?
Watch her.
Poor Tom, your cup is empty.
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind.
I’ll ask them.
If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
I told them to take  Oh, what a big mistake!
Oh ho, oh ho!
Do I speak to you kindly?
What should I say to her?
Here he comes.
You could’ve done this without your beard and gown.
My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.
Please just listen.
Oh, it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets, taking their scent with it.
Will I be married tomorrow morning?
Halt!
I’m not like that now.
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.
I want you to do some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both.
All you English princes, I salute you.
That’s just what he said in the letter.
He’s just Launcelot.
I’m asking you to understand my point of view.
I was wrong to her— Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?
That’s no lie.
Yes, it’s William, sir.
And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.
Good night to you.
Are you done yet?
You, Roderigo!
Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome.
This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room.
Who takes care of them?
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.
It’s hard to make sense of such different stories.
You’re a traveler.
And I saw her do it.
Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.
Roderigo’s been killed?
What are you doing with a sword?
Do you know his plans?
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.
I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast.
Let me tell you, friends—
Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio.
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.
I can’t do everything I want to, but I’ll help you as well as I can.
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
I’m going.
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams.
When did I  Do you know where you are, sir?
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
Why?
Take that, and that!
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God.
Groan?
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs.” Crisscrossed?
Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women.
He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious.
Let me finish my curse.
The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services.
And he would have deserved it too.
Very near, and approaching fast.
Sure I can, father.
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age!
Medicine is for the dogs.
To none but you, only to you.
A snail?
Let’s go.
Do you know whom you’re talking to?
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
Punish me if it’s not true.
Oh you damned villain!
Right, and well said.
The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.
Why do you come here?
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.
Blow the trumpets.
She’s dead to me.
He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men.
Call my knights together.
Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.
You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words.
Honestly, it’s not as good as the other one, and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me.
The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar, but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit.
She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
It’s good to grow.
I know his soul’s in heaven, fool.
You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones—you’re men.
We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad.
And has my armor been put in my tent?
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.
Cassio doesn’t know you.
I’ve got nothing to do with you.
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
There you go.
Yes, they’re spirits that I’ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims.
Stop whining, devil.
Here comes Catesby again.
Nobody I care about more than myself.
Yes.
Only until noon, my lord?
You seem all right now.
How could it be wisdom!
Did you call for me, your Worship?
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before.
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts.
Do that, my friend.
Romeo!
My God, that’s my handkerchief!
Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done.
I remember his face well.
Here come the conspirators.
This is rebellion.
He’s welcome here.
Of brave earls, Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
He stayed like that a long time.
Malcolm!
He will die.
Did you see him enter this abbey?
Sir, my king, don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is.
Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles.
It’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger.
Good night, lieutenant.
Okay.
Will you come with me?
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
Peter, did you ever see anything like it?
He’s not your relative.
Friends, come here.
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.
She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
Don’t worry, Baptista, you’ll be perfectly satisfied.
Don’t waste any time.
Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her.
No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening.
I hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts.
That’s good, if he’ll really do it.
Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.
If your highness is willing, take revenge on him for that—because I know you’re brave enough, I don’t dare to— That’s for sure.
But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes.
I’ll do the best I can, my lord.
I think Belman is just as good, my lord.
Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia, she’s been upset.
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
To, to, to— To murder me?
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements.
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned.
Go wherever you want.
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.
Me, “greedy”!
The heart won’t be reasoned with.
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father.
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.
It was yours, I swear.
And let the wise man run away.
So the fool follows you.
Go, blockheads, go, and bring my supper to me.  
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make.
Oh-ho-ho, sir!
It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.
But God forbid he says no to us!
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now.
Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.
Will you be crowned tomorrow?
I don’t like it.
How?
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk.
It’s my duty, sir.
Get her attention and draw her home with music.
My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven.
Well, well, let’s go.
My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
That’s the curse of military service.
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline.
Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.
What, are we playing with interjections?
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
Is your master awake?
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons.
An angel is walking on earth.
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.
I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away.
Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.
Good evening, brother.
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose.
So please, old friend, give us some good advice.
Why are you calling him a jerk?
Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
I know your position.
Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them.
Father, this isn’t easy for me.
Wasn’t that the best thing to do?
Wasn’t that letter from Jessica?
I will kiss your lips.
It looks that way.
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
I am still so faithful, my lord.
Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.
We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.
Listen.
What man is that?
One of us will stay and stand guard.
Who can stain that name with a just accusation?
It’s nothing.
Not if the minor ones come up first.
Speak.
It’s too frightened to look at itself.
I’ll back you up.
Yes, and it seemed twice as long to me, having been kept from your bed that whole time.
And this is Metellus Cimber.
The poor souls—how strangely they talk!
I’d like to know.
What blessed work, my king.
Oh, my good master!
I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.
I have received letters that say the same.
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars.
Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight!
A leathermaker will last nine years.
See the wound that Casca made.
I think you’re my mirror, not my brother.
The table’s full.
Tell me, who is this knight?
No, my good knight.
At least tell me where you’re going.
You couldn’t find out anything about them?
I’m to blame for making you wait for me.
When I send for you, come out wearing masks.
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
One last thing, and this is up to you.
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward.
Why, are we turning to men?
Who can explain this to me?
Do you hear that, Charmian?
Come on, Sir Andrew.
If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia.
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.
Worthy sir, greetings!
Well, good for him!
Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh.
Run away, I beg you!
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
And like I am for Ganymede.
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
No, the one I gave you.
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
Where is she?
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
No, not tonight.
Tell me, spirit, how’s the king and his entourage?
I wear it with pride, for I am Welsh you know, good countryman.
Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?
Rest easy in the meantime.
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.
Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons.
Why are you curious, Iago?
Come, come.
I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
Soldier, why are you wearing that glove in your cap?
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow.
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
May a plague curse both your families.
Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you.
You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you.
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.
Remember March, March 15th.
I hope with all my heart she will!
You’ll see.
You can trust me.
I know you well.
Get out of here, good Fleance, run, run, run!
Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore.
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milk cows, a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables, and all the equipment necessary to maintain them.
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over.
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply.
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand?
Is this the king we offered to ransom?
I knew from the first it would be this way.
And what would that accomplish?
Go home!
Call my guard, please.
So Litio’s out of the picture.
How do you feel, Laertes?
They have a massive army.
Give me the vial.
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting.
I wish she were in love with me instead.
Ariel, you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered.
As soon as you kill Prospero.
Come, my sweet Kate.
Yes, that’s for sure.
What can I say to him, lady?
My good man Norfolk, hurry to your post.
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave.
That’s the one.
Well, the  Shall we get moving?
Prepare your troops.
You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.
My name is Pistol.
Welcome, my lord.
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do.
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
I sent him there, sir, but his crimes deserved a worse punishment.
I’ll smear my face with filth, put on a loincloth, make my hair matted and tangled, and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing.
It’s my birthday.
For God’s sake, find a house to duck into.
It has the mark of 
Oh, what an excellent young man!
We’ve been waiting a long time for this day.
Good morning to you, friend.
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
Here, Peter Quince.
It’s not quite that simple.
Oh, royal Caesar!
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us.
My gracious king.
Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too.
Good Mr. Peaseblossom, I’d like to get to know you better too.—And you, may I ask what your name is, sir?
He tried to kill me recently, very recently.
Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer.
Oh, sad day!
Well then, God forgive me!
Swords don’t frighten me.
Nothing, except your true love for my lord.
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses.
Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
Well, you can go now.
A ghost, a ghost!
Strike!
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
You are all    Lord of lords!
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!
Good evening to your Worship, good Captain James.
The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun.
Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size.
You should know that I think you’re a smart man.
Did you notice?
Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say.
They have wings.
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.  
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
May my wrinkles forbid that!
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
Why didn’t they just kill us that night?
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
But wait, there’s some prose after her poem.
What a farce!
Do you see something wrong with that?
I could do it easily now.
That will tell you a lot.
Before I hear him, I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France.
Oh, I’ve read that.
Is this the Prince’s brother?
These ones, then, will be assassinated.
What did he tell you, Ophelia?
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans.
Or are you just pretending?
You must be over there.
Any strange beast there can be considered a man.
Here comes the lady.
Yes, sir.
I think that our father will leave here tonight.
We’re friends!
Is there any more, or is that it?
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments.
How foolish your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it.
Shall I be tempted by the devil?
Is this face Hero’s?
I didn’t say anything.
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better?
It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.
Isn’t that your habit?
Tell us, Bottom.
Don’t snap at me.
What else?
He certainly is.
What do you think of these quick-witted folks, Gremio?
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
Quiet!
Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!
Why are you so far from home?
Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it.
Is there anything else you wish?
Do not, Phoebe.
I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick.
Some other time.
I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
Let them marry your children!
But you don’t love me.
Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
Some  Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace.
The crows flying down below look as small as ants.
What a day this is!
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned.
If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor.
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.
Yet you killed my children.
After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.
Let’s talk.
Lie down right there.  
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet.
Please, young sir.
We should definitely say something to the Moor.
If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.
Hello, beautiful Helena!
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words.
The king is virtuous and kind.
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?
That’s it?
Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by.
It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before.
Go ahead.
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
How short am I?
Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?
If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man.
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel!
Is this servant of yours a smart man?
Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell.
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!
Alright, I will.
Is that possible?
Come on, then.
She’s cheating on me?
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.
I’ve said what I have to say.
Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations.
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
What work can you do?
Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here.
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.
Oh, noble weakness!
ate at home, but the jeweler says he didn’t.
A gentleman.
I would not.
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
They sit chatting by the parlor fire.
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms.
Be quiet and depart.
Go on, go on.
She looks like she’s washing her hands.
And don’t lie.
When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up.
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
Keep me balanced and sane.
And she’s fierce, even though she’s little.
Send for the Count.
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?
Well, I think that even if it weren’t on record, the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next—all the way to Doomsday.
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.
Oh, Caesar!
Maybe he won’t see me.
He got there too late.
Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead, what would happen to me?
Then we’ll be stuffed with news.
I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.
Well, do your best.
Your head, my lord?
Gracious Lord, blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again!
Not tonight, Iago.
Likewise, our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes, and their wounded steeds, ankle-deep in gore, struggle and, raging wildly, stamp on their dead masters with their hooves, killing them a second time.
Just watch!
What we do we have been commanded to do.
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
Farewell.
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.
I’ll speak to him now.
My prayers, you hussy?
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.
Madam!
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and reward me if I tell the truth!
Please let me go.
Speak confidently.
I know him well.
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool.
When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements.
What does she want?
Repent and avoid damnation.
Captain, I have a favor to beg of you.
And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown!
I don’t have to give you answers that you like.
Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh!
Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you.
You will be whipped.  
We’ll eat at her place.
If I decide to get angry at you, just watch out— You’d be done for then, monster.
An old Italian fox is never that generous, my boy.
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask!
The day is well on its way.
Here is the cap your Worship ordered.
Who is her mother?
Besides, you’re a sponge!
Bless your five senses!
That’s very soon.
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him.
Farewell!
She already has a face.
With his ambition growing like this—do you hear what I’m saying?
Take this mad wretch to jail.—Father-in-law Baptista, will you see that he’s available to appear in court?
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.
Gregory, remember how to slash.
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep.
Please treat my babies well.
Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits.
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good.
How do you do, sir.
I wish I had never seen it!
Yes, you’re absolutely right.
Not me.
Are you hurt, lieutenant?
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
But she is wise.
Oh my!
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
How is Hamlet?
Yes, and paid me well for doing it.
Oh sirs, consider this: those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it.
Go to bed, dear.
Isn’t he here?
Read it instantly.
How’s that?
My trusty servant, Ariel!
What’s the matter?
If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.
You take your beauty sleep now.
There they go, Silver!
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived.
almost read people’s thoughts.
She is banished.
You can take your chances after dinner.
Think about it.
The Constable of France.
Brutus speaks.
When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk.
Farewell.
I have news—old news such as you never heard before!
Why are your swords out?
If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.
Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew.
He rushed away on serious business.
Until then, I have to remain calm.
If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
Me too.
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?
I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.
His letter will tell you how he’s doing.  
No one will listen to it.
Shut up, fool!
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around. 
But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.
It’s time to end it, good lady.
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.
If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride.
And so I’m dying.
For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange.
I know you’ll offer nothing less than that.
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him.
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
Please take them off.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep.
We’ll meet at the Elephant.
Stanley, what news do you have?
Tomorrow is the day.
Now, Catesby, what does your lord say to my request?
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy.
Let me know.
He’s wearing yellow stockings.
They sing when they die.
I hit hard when I’m angry.
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father?
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.
There, take that, you scoundrel!
Come, sweet Audrey.
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
Who, Hero?
If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need.
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
He’s called Modo and Mahu.
Come on, what did Romeo say?
He’s insane.
Please, educate me.
Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away.
Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption?
She’s round, like a globe.
I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either.
I’m Christopher Sly, son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath, a peddler by birth, a  Oh, this is why your poor wife is mourning!
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor.
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive.
What do you want, fellow?
My brother’s love, the devil, and my own anger made me do it.
It’s too late.
No, I’m not wound up.
My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.
No, no, with God’s help, his son will be king.
He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands.
I’m going to go drown myself.
giving it back to him.
Their messengers are ready, waiting to deliver our response in these matters.
Is the visor of my helmet working better now?
Now be quiet.
You’re busted.
Don’t tell us what our duty is.
Eyes, do you see?
I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself.
You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady?
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
In bed with her?
Who are you?
But you should hurry anyway.
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
Have you seen my lord?
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn.
And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass.
I’m sure there was a herd of lions nearby.
Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
Tell her that I, her king, am her lowly subject.
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.                      
But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell!
It will be hard if “Cambio” loses her.
Give it up and go drink.  
Now that’s patience!
You’re a senator!
The  Right.
I would’ve been a sore king then.
Loss upon loss!
Everything’s out of control.
Be free and happy.
I’m going back into battle.
Ring the alarm bell.
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them.
By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know.
I can only repeat what I’ve said before.
All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short.
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
Sir, let’s get to the point.
Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains.
Who’s closest to him?
I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.
I don’t have a lord.
Agreed.
Write them together—yours is just as good a name.
God bless you for being here.
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
Because, if you must know, she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio.
Out, out, brief candle.
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings.
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?
What do you want?
This chatter is no cure for my toothache.
Make these men work.
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.
Order them to escape.
Good.
Is it that early in the day?
It’s a wild night.
So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for.
Your servant Kent.
I bet it’s a love letter!  
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner.
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.
It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away.
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide.
These are ugly antics.
Don’t argue against it.
Do whatever you like with it.
Excellently, excellently.
Maybe, but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him.
Go.
Look who’s coming.
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole.
Have a safe trip.
Oh, Lord!
She will  A pimp!
Where is he?
Some startling news has just arrived, sir.
No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself.
As I vowed, I will unite the York and Lancaster families.
Sad, my lady!
Did you call me, my lord?
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
What do you say, Caesar?
I can tell by the way you waggle your head.
Just let me say one prayer!
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch—though no lighter than I should be.
Where is this man?
You scoundrel!
We don’t want it at our festivities.
At Pembroke, or at Harfordwest in Wales.
He’s as brave as a fox.
No, not a sad song.
Retreat further, my lord, retreat further.
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love.
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself.
For instance, our husbands
Now I’ll believe that unicorns exist, and that there’s a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives.
Yes, if the devil tempts you to do good.
I will, my Hermia.
Where is the number of our English dead?
I didn’t think you could even be so angry.
What do you want?
Didn’t they pass by you?
The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary.
Now all is for nothing.
Bring that swinger Orlando here.
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert.
All cooped up together, just as you ordered, all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather.
Too bad about the son!
Shame on you; I’ve already run out of patience with you all.
I’m not sure I can wait that long.
If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me.
It’s a cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.
Do you hear us, sir?
It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
Here, sir!
Peaseblossom.
Be quiet.
Sir Toby Belch!
It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike.
Regan, is that what you said?
If he fears God, he must necessarily keep the peace.
Give me my robe, because I’m going.
Oh, sir, on her nose, which is covered with pimples, sores, and red welts.
This box was tested in the fire seven times.
Come down, look no more.
In a way” is the right way to go.
What, are you dead, my dove?
It cannot be.
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me.
Don’t worry about me.
If that’s true, then don’t be tongue-tied.
I’m going to sell all my land.
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen.
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.
I want to drink your health.
Yes, he’ll weep stones, as he taught us to do.
You abused me to my face.
I admit I’m only a woman, but I’m still a woman from a noble family—I’m Cato’s daughter.
With this ring I give them all to you.
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little.
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.
I know that my hour has come.
Oh!
Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.
I won’t break this promise.
It’s yours.
Was a man ever beaten as much as me?
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Oh, forgive me!
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed.
Yes, but that makes me love you even more.
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes.
Good night, good brother.
Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies.
You are welcome here, sister.
Me too.
Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard.
But I have the meantime.
When he stands where I am and sees you there.  
Her father loves you, Demetrius.
No, none at all.
Pretending?
I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.
We can’t wait here.
Isn’t that what he said?
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master.
Are you going to let us in?
The king acts unnaturally—father against child.
I want my bond, so stop talking.
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour.
What an awful day!
I want to forget what I am.
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.
I like doing things the old-fashioned way.
Who was it?
Please don’t tell me any more.
Is that possible?
God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey.
Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard!
He’s given me a second life, and marrying her makes him a second father to me.
What’s her name?
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.
I’m sick, Charmian.
Only really cruel people can be called deformed.
Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?
Near  How large is his land army?
Don’t delay.
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
Hail, King of Scotland!
What?
Bring out the stocks!
I thank you for that quip, good Tranio.
Take a tip from me, then.
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
Hmm, let me see:
Claribel, his daughter.
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.
So be calm.
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.
I know that voice.
A snake could do that as easily as you could.
Wish me luck.
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
I did.
I’ll be good, sir.
Even that I could put up with.
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy.
Help me!
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.
Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands, if only a girl could catch one for herself.
I was about to swear that I loved you.
Hey, mistress!
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork.
You think you can get rid of me that easily?
If your Majesty would like, I’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like.
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!
Don’t you have any manners, you savage?
Cassius, what a night this is!
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me.
What’s going on between you two?
I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.
Oh, sirs, if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I would offend Brutus and Cassius, who, you all know, are honorable men.
But you turn that sun into a shadow.
I never saw you before in my life.
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
A drum!
How horrible!
What’s that paper you were reading?
Come here, man.
But I’m ashamed to kiss, sir.
Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong.
Go to your cabins and be quiet!
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
No.
But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.
Should I blab to her that you’re coming?
And keep yourself hidden, I command you.
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.
Your lord knows what I think.
The moon’s bright tonight.
Sir, this is the truth: you and the rest—all the people who have ever talked about her—have all been wrong.
Fine, thank you.
Oh, just lies, sir.
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man.
I will, my lord.
Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart.
If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known.
What a tunneler!
Yes, Caesar, but it’s not gone yet.
My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English?
A gentleman?
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.
Wasn’t he born from a woman?
So, I agree with noble Buckingham—only a few should go to meet the prince.
I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island, where he’s sitting now sighing, with his arms crossed like this.
I’ll do so.
If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones.
It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Oh, my poor brother!
If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story.
Please, sir, I beg you.
If he struggles, use force!
I swear I’m not lying.
Is your other mouth calling my name?
These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus.
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
Open it and read it.
The curfew-bell rang.
Maria, our lady wants you.
In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm.
Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do.
Give me your hand, Roderigo.
Good morning, Brutus.
Yes, leeks are good.
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
Next month he’ll stay with us.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
I am one, my lord.
Eros!
He’s been captured or killed.
What a lying, drunken monster.
Swear by my sword.
As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered.
Come, firebrands, over here!
Time’s not the one in debt.
Don’t disturb his soul.
That’s five to one.
Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.
Bring her out, brother.
What’s that noise?
Answer me straightforwardly.
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
We’re being haunted.
Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here!
Isn’t that what they said?
It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.
Goodbye.
How are you, Roderigo?
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business.
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
and affection, even if it’s just an act.
He was graced with lots of natural gifts, he was young, valiant, wise, and no doubt meant to be king.
Your mother sends her blessings.
Come on, I’ll fight you.
The king—whom I hope God will protect better than you would like—can’t get a minute’s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints.
So let’s join forces and get revenge.
Okay, but tonight doesn’t count.
They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it.
Good night.
Goodbye.
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up.
I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.
That’s what I intend to do too.
Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.
Come on, let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up.
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go.
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
What is the matter here?
But don’t expect any more than that.
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.
Come with me, and let’s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words.
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.
I’m not possessed!
I don’t know why he’s come here.
So that England may live a long life like this, let God say amen!
I don’t know what to think about this.
Read your history!
Run to the Capitol and nothing else?
I will proclaim my name around the field.
You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!
Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
Here is his Majesty.
I have forgotten why I called you back.
But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for?
I was an idiot to take it!
If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made.
Launcelot, what’s going on?
And now who but you knows whether I’m yours?
Very clever!
I’ll bleed to death.
Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight?
What would I do besides good?
I’m the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates.
Tomorrow, and then every day after that.
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Dolabella!
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood.
If you see me without it, you can be confident I’m dead.
Now I’ve done a good day’s work.
Yes, my lord.
But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more.
I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me.
Where is your husband?
I still have room for six more wounds.
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now!
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender.
True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.
It is.
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime.
Are you joking?
If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there.
It’s nice of you to remind me.
All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already.
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out.
But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions.
It’s weird.
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself.
Sailors, sir.
But I don’t hate Orlando.
To supper?
I know the glove is a glove.
If you’d like to talk tomorrow, I’ll come to your home.
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born.
I swear I will never break this promise of love.
If you do intend to live, then mourn.
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant.
Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king?
Goodbye then, Hero.
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.
The enemy approaches with great display.
I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.
I’m full of joy.
I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
What’s the trouble?
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!
Our forces are ready for them.
What he just said to me—it’s alright.
Shouldn’t she just accept that?
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.
Go, daughter.
On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.
The moon looks sad to me.
I know it’s the moon.
Faster, Eros, faster.
Good night then, Casca.
It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice.
We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow.
He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children.
He’s married to Octavia, madam.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
What?
Why are you talking like that?
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.
No, monster, not me.
Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.
What is it?
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men!
There’s some gentleman out there.— Good Sir Toby!
Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers.
The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell.
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living.
Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
Goodbye!
And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy.
No, you have to forget all that now.
But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him.
Descend.
Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest.
No.  
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me, and then killed herself.
She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how.
Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t.
If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?
Think about our situation, then die.
I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel.
Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
Why, may I ask?
That makes me love you even more.
You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate.
How long has he been there?
Now I’ve said it twice.
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
She’s gone forever.
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—
What, you mean kid actors?
I’m going to let him live.
I’ll do well.
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood.
You’re wise!
When they’re endangered, I save them.
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.
But when exactly will we see Benedick married?
I never gave him reason to be jealous.
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.
As long as hell and Richard want it.
Listen up, uncle.
I do.
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.
How will you wreck this marriage?
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
Go back again, slave, and bring him home.
Yes, just as great and just as recent.
I will.
My words are dull.
He’s staying in the forest with your father now.
I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise!—And you, oh Wall, oh sweet, oh lovely Wall, you stand between her father’s property and mine, you Wall, oh Wall, oh sweet and lovely Wall.
It was me, no one else.
If this letter doesn’t make him fight, I don’t know what will.
I don’t have any news to report, my lord.
Well, first of all, my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out.
Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.
Make us your agents of revenge, so we can praise you when we’re victorious!
I’ll tear her to pieces!
Then pack up your instruments and go away.
Their dying shouts broke my heart!
Don’t talk about Helena.
Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you.
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.
But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.
Why did you send so many?
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration!
And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you?
I swear, this fool has an excellent singing voice.
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.
How is she doing?
Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king.
You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart.
Please, remain seated.
What can you do but be happy?
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples?
I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.
He thinks “G” is me.
Very well.
We have not betrayed you.
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there.
How did you tolerate prison?
Come on.
I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more.
Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time.
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.
He’s a marvelously witty fellow, no doubt, but I’ll outmaneuver him.—Come over here; I’ll whisper a word in your ear.
But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.
The devil’s after me!
You’re awfully eager to fight.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Ah, poor ghost!
But tell me seriously who it is.
I’m off, my lord.
You would make a nasty suitor.
That’s the end of the announcement.
Thanks for letting me go.
I’ll listen to Brutus.
He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
Damn it all!
There I’ll see only myself.
What’s that noise?
God bless you.
Rub his temples.
Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
Nurse?
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?
May you die of the worst disease!
And did you see the handkerchief?
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
What’s the news?
Fight valiantly today.
Oh what a curse marriage is!
Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, for a whole hour now.
If you don’t want to, then good riddance.
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.
Oh, go, leave me.
Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court.
Agincourt.
God protect me from these two!
If you poison us, don’t we die?
I will do more, though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime, asking for pardon.
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God,” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me?
Jailer, keep an eye on him.
Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?  
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy.
I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears.
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country.
The nasty devil’s biting my butt.
Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to.
Has he come home yet?
Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck.
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl.
Please, tell us.
You’ll have to bear with me.
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now.
Lighten up.
Stop, for God’s sake!
Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church.
Madam, keep up hope.
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?
You should have reprimanded him for that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
My sword and I will earn our place in history.
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
That’s strange.
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
It’s a common  What?
You talk to him, ma'am.
And you’re not suited for any place except hell.
But step aside, fairy!
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
But let him come.
Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”?
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
Did you talk with him?
Who’s this?
Iago has kept his word.
The general should be informed about this.
Don’t you suspect my office?
Are you that impatient?
Reluctantly, I agreed–alas!
The poor thing, he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see.
By my faith in love, I will, then.
I do dare, and I say that you are the villain.
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?
You can’t get any more money out of me right now.
No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius.
Honestly, I didn’t see it, but I felt it in her hot breath.
I like you guys.
She’ll confirm everything.
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is, to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity.
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents.
A hundred then.
I can read my own fortune in my misery.
No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy.
Give me your hand.
Let the world collapse around us.
Please, sir, have patience.
Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others.
Not true.
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom.
Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.
You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness!
Here’s a drink.
What are you talking about?
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors.
Your servants are waiting.
Are you ill?
Farewell, kind lord.
It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this.
The day, my friends, and everything await me.
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven.
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion.
Let’s go!
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.
I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her.
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.
He is the general challenger.
I’ll tell you what to do.
There’s no other shelter around here.
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.
And here comes the warden, just in time.
Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?
Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten?
No, he just gets reality completely wrong.
I’ll pick berries for you.
Just a bit of my dry humor, sir.
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way.
If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.
Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes.
Help, my lord of Norfolk, help, help!
Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste.
Get yourself to a 
She was too good for me.
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes?
And they thought Margaret was Hero?
This is what Calphurnia’s dream means.
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
No, Cassius, no.
Both of you are very welcome here.
I am unfit to rule and to be king.
Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll do it.
The Queen is here, my lord.
You can’t see the future.
Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!
Choose another tack.
My wife was killed too?
But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?
I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.
Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.
Yes, sir, it’s all too true, God help us.
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.
May good fortune come to you, good Petruchio!
Wake up!
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.
Oh, dear.
Just send him here, and I’ll persuade him.
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
Go, then, mother, to your daughter.
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there.
Stand further away.
Well, that’s a fine answer.
To save her life, I’ll say she doesn’t.
Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies.
Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go.
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time.
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.
Where’s my cousin Toby?
That’s because you are near me, and you’re as dazzling as the sun.
This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that.
He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it.
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color.
Then they’re cold friends to me.
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
I’m really a pitiful singer.
I have a wife I love.
Lord, what fools these mortals are!
Which one of you is the lady of the house?
I’m ready to hear you.
Sadness takes away our color.
Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
I rely on your virtue to protect me.
I’m done for in this world, I believe.
Yes, it is, I think.
The question is, how would being king change him?
You mean an officer?
May He bless you, too.
But where will we go?
What is logical, then, my lord?
Come out, you frightened man.
Goodbye.
He’s definitely drunk now.
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.
I urge you to deliver your verdict.
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.
No more than that, my lord.
This way, we can see how the world moves.
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow.
For God’s sake, shut up!
We’ll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow.
What part of her body is Ireland?
Madam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.
What a king Claudius is!
God bless you.
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart.
What have I said in my grief?
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father?
Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity.
I’ll go to him.
What’s important is the urgency of this mission.
What are they doing on the road?
Your Juliet is alive.
She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook.
You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
Now go!
Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission.
And where’s Cordelia?— Do you see this, Kent?
Fire!
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
Oh my, my bones ache so much.
Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod.
I’m not afraid of anyone but him.
Come with me, please.
Come on, let’s go to prison.
But we already swore, sir.
Why are you hiding that letter?
Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.
Are those my tents on fire?
And he’s friendly with Caesar.
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
Let’s give them room.
Yes, ma'am.
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.
Did you call me?
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.
I’d say the same thing, but I’m afraid I’d be faced out of my way.
The ground feels flat to me.
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began, “Wonder of nature—” I have heard a sonnet to one’s mistress that began like that.
Let’s go up to the castle.
Will you break my heart?
Yes, if that would be all right with your Lordship.
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.
I won’t have anything to do with it.
We want to hear Caesar’s will.
I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards.
Bring me to my host, Macbeth.
The English army, sir.
What you just said may perhaps be true.
If you could only hear this testament—which, excuse me, I don’t intend to read aloud—you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood, and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by.
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy.
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar.
Oh yes—to smell  This is Signor Antonio.  
Here comes better news.
My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before.
Yes, that’s my husband’s name.
His feelings don’t move in that direction.
I say it’s the moon.
Oh, poor shepherd!
Why did you once seem lovely to me?
If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous.
Keep an eye on him.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man.
I’ll fight brutally.
The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.
I can’t go any further, sir.
Once again you bring good news.
This is his sword.
I flashed about faster than lightning.
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.
Here’s a goat for you.
You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.
Give me your hand.
Unfaithful?
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me.
Oh, ho!
If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself.
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?
What, my good lord?  
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this.
Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.
If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
That’s what I’m doing.
I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell.
I’ll drink later.
He has killed me, Mother.
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody.
If I’m more noble than you, you’ve done me wrong.
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
Aren’t you my father?
Why, so did you.
He will, sir, if He wants to.
I certainly will, sir.
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed.
But I reversed the death sentence.
My name is Mary, sir.
So I die with a kiss.
These are the messengers from my sister and the king.
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
I won’t have any of this.
Yes, hand me one too.
Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.
Arrest me if you dare.
Gloucester’s eyes?
Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming?
That is the key to long-lasting love.
We won’t go today—or any day until it’s clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is.  
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
Keep your promise, my love.
Stay warm.
However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look.
I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married, loving their father only.
Well, go on your way, then.
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight.
My lord!
But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it.
You come with me, uncle of Exeter.
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Sir, please, don’t be angry.
Do you have news from Verona!—What is it, Balthasar?
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
Then hurry up and tell me what you want.
What, are you afraid?
I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!
Everything’s fine now.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Risk everything for lead?
You don’t know me.
If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care.
She’ll have to have it.
You’re alive.
Are you good or evil?
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
What should I do?
How do you both plead?
Go to him from me.
First kiss me, Kate, and then we will.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
I’m not talking about proof yet.
I know I’m not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.
In the meantime, be patient.
I can.
No, sir.
And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick.
We won’t, sir.
What did he say?
Go on, tell it.
I know all of this.
Good night, madam.
Young man, your father’s dead.
What then, sick?
Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.
The prince has far outgrown me.
I’m here, my lord.
I’ve botched the job, friends.
Cough them up.
It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help.
Oh Setebos, these are handsome spirits!
Bloody, inhuman villain!
Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously.
I do.
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?
No.
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?
I hear someone coming.
But his investments are uncertain right now.
Yes, let’s do that.
All I have to do is remove it.
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property, I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter.
Say, what’s the trouble?
Call me the worst liar?
Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed.
Be sure to burn his magic books.
My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake.
Has Banquo left the court?
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.
I’ll bring you to him right away.
Madam, what should I do?
Nor is it up to you, my lord.
He was wrong to do that.
What, there’s going to be a masquerade?
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever, and will make me, Caliban, your worshipful foot-licker.
Let go of his arm.
Give me my fan, Peter.
Here’s money for you.
Now, by St. George, my knighthood, and my crown— The first you profaned, the second you dishonored, and the third you stole.
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good, and enemies into friends!
What do you say, Signior Gremio?
God bless you, Mr.
But his ambition—for that, I killed him.
Are these spirits we see before us?
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.
That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
Go.
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back.
Did she see you there the whole time, old boy?
Calm down.
Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry.
The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.
I’ll never speak to you again.
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?
Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain.
Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female.
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do.
I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.
My arm is sore.
Come, gentlemen, let’s go in.
I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets.
I wish this trick would be over.
Good-bye.
I stand here with the law on my side.
Angelo, the jeweler.
Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport.
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve.
Yes, here it is.
Trebonius!
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!
Yes, I do, sir.
I’ll bring you to him.
I hope to see good days—and many of them.
Until the day we die, my lord.
Wow, he’s a real devil.
Wholeheartedly, good young man.
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed.
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals.
But you’re lying out in the cold.
It isn’t daybreak yet.
Okay.
Didn’t you hear her, guys?
For various reasons that must remain secret, please do this for me.
On my honor, I swear I love Rivers with all my heart.
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
You sent for me, sir?
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
And after this I’ll be good and hope you forgive me.
I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Rivers and Grey, holy King Henry and your fine son Edward, Vaughan, and all who have died from underhanded, corrupt, fiendish injustice, if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds, enjoy the revenge—laugh at my ruin!
Whatever has already been done can’t be undone now.
Oh great, here come the Capulets.
I’ll see her like this.
So I  Your Honor’s actors, hearing of your recovery, have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you—and your doctors approve wholeheartedly.
What’s your profession?
Well, I hope not.
Why are you knocking so hard?
I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire.
If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.
I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance.
Have him come to me here, soldier.
You’ll be my role model.
I don’t know, sir.
What’s going on here?
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.
Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.
Where are the evil men who started this fight?
May God thank you for it.
I’ve locked it up in my room.
I swear to you, many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before.
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall.
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me.
How is my Juliet?
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind.
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.
Father, what’s the news?
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest.
Ah, you sorceress!
Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter.
Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
The handkerchief!
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor.
Oh, what misery!
What would you like me to do at Salisbury?
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.
That’ll keep them from being afraid.
Yes, really.
Bring us some wine!
Didn’t I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you?
My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy 
Your last guess is right.
Give me the necklace!
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
Farewell, brother.
I’m off to Venice.
What’s that trumpet for?
Hey, Nurse!
My servants might overhear, and old Gremio is still hanging around, so we might be interrupted.
Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.
Give my love to my kind husband.
All traitors protest like this.
If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
She can’t possibly have done you any wrong.
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
You pale face!
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
Do you lie so low?
Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
Did you inform them of that?
What news, man?
Your Majesty is quite right.
Hey, what’s this, Adam?
Isn’t he a horrible man?
I’m glad to hear it.
Have you ever cured anyone this way before?
Here comes the man himself.
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?
It’s entirely possible.
Twenty crowns?
Yes.
Now, Eros.
But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!
Oh, sir, the problem goes far deeper than you realize.
Farewell.
My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.
What villains did this to you?
Go ahead, use your authority.
My master’s calling me.
No one shows mercy because he has to.
Tell me so I can be satisfied.
If you have poison for me, I’ll drink it.
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you, Ceres, goddess of the fields and the earth, to leave your rich farms of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas, the hills where the
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
Sweet marjoram.
You!
If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all inside?
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.
Just you wait.
Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings.
Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint.
I can swim like a duck, I swear.
Has it been a quiet night?
Go, coward that you are.
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.
Please let me go.
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi.
Hold the friar too.
Oh Lord, who’s that crying?
If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
A friend.
Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done?
This haunting business is even stranger than murder.
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night.
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
Yes, one, and this is how I did it.
Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother.
My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone.
Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay?
I’d like you to, see, because you don’t like it, and because it isn’t to your taste, and because it doesn’t agree with you.
My master is being difficult.
Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again.
Go away and let me die.
Have you seen Master Lorenzo!
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
It’s your music, madam, from your house.
He’s a traitor.
Yes, you’re right.
What else is love?
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.
Look, here’s the necklace.
He’s gone?
My lord, his throat is cut.
I think it’s better to call it off.
Yes, I did, my lord.
You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.
Where are you, Death?
I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
Murder!
I’m telling you, it was Carthage.
No, sir.
Here he is, here he is.
They’re out to get me, and I won’t stand for it!
Go on ahead.
You’re up early.
Said what, sir?
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing.
I told him that your father was in Venice, and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today.
I hate no-good drunks.
You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you.
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to.
That’s where I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.
Nothing.
Oh, this is treachery!
Hello, Iago.
More and more light.
Check on your daughter, your house, your money!
Call the messengers!  
For the love of God, be patient with him.
They’re well too.
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be.
Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.
And you’re not loyal, like us.
Yes, and that’s a serious failing.
I won’t speak to her.
Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore.
Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.
What do you say?
Good-bye, my lord.
No, no, he’s dead.
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us.
Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash.
We don’t need to hear it.
No, my lord.
Look, it’s going away.
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
Yes, it stinks very sweetly.
My lord, I have news for you.
You’ve come right on time.
What is it, Biondello?
It’s true, I confess.
And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you.
Alas, my lord, your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom.
My lord, please go inside here.
What are you thinking about so seriously?
Oh-ho-ho, kid!
Oh, what evil!
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion.
No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.
I’m not a fighter.
One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
Passionately”?
He really is the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria.
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
It’s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea.
Places, everyone!
This is the man.
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.
What soldiers, milk-face?
What did you say?
You know where I live.
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
Now, welcome, Kate.—And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman.
I did.
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree.
He wants to be crowned.
She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying for a happy marriage.
Goodnight, Michael.
Then where would you have me go, Adam?
What’s that sound?
Tell me what I want to know.
You won’t kill me, will you?
But what’s this I see?
They told me I was everything.
What income, what profit does it bring in?
Run as if your life depended on it.
I plan to fall into the blackest despair.
From now on this is what I’ll think of your love.
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.
Who sent you here?
What are the chances of his getting better, lords?
I’ll go to lunch.
Madam?
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me.
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Damn your wine!
Look, here comes our honored hostess!
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.
How can you square things with me?
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.
Call out my household servants.
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools.
Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
Get information from her.
Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me.
If people take what he says, fine.
Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
Ah, no.
Is it them?
Yes, this is what love does.
Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?
So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.
Now, don’t forget, you promised me something.
My darling Othello!
That’s the point.
Clink your cups together in a toast!
Oh, you’re so lucky!
The work we enjoy is not really work.
Right.
Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!
Heaven help him!
I’m the one who— I’ll get right on that.
Give my compliments to your lady.
I know you.
Hello, brother Edmund.
The whole town will riot!
It’s a lot to ask of a maiden.
But wait, what’s that sound?
Run, master, run.
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!
Yes ,madam.
My lord, my life is as important to me as yours is to you, and it was never as precious to me as it is now.
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me.
The harvest comes shortly after that.
I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host.
Please, don’t make fun of me.
Bring him my head.
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
Where do you live?
What must be will be.
No man must know.” What comes after that?
She stood and spoke.
Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress?
And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty.
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him.
Who am I, sir?
I’d be as right for the job as you are, and I’d do it more easily, since I’d have good will on my side.
Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him.
Are you ready, sir?
Stay here, Titinius.
Hurry up.
Take three times your money.
Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven.
What’s up, man?
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself.
No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best.
I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished.
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear.
If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!
Why are they shouting?
Don’t ask me what I know.
I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason.
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals.
It’s the death of half the world. 
I beg you to continue to be patient.
Will it eat me?
Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat.
This is to feel the news, not hear it.
I can’t figure it out by myself!
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.
Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me?
Me too, lieutenant.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
Leave me and do what I told you to do.
Poor man!
The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate.
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her.
Signor Lodovico?
I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously.
If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go.
You may, sir.
To work as a servant.
A knight on a quest?
What do you think, will my friends prove loyal?
But who is this person, sir?
It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord.
And what’s the point, sir?
My own ears heard it, and you know it.
I overheard him and his plans.
My ear must pull it out.
What, Gertrude?
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
Give me your hand, first. 
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster.
When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him.
Be calm, dear lady.
Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason.
My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise.
That’s my brave lord!
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons.
You there, sir, come here please.
Now I want her more than ever.
Sirs, never mind.
A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim.
So have your money ready.
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.
Ask me any commonsense question.
Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die.
I think you’ve been frowning too much recently.
Exactly, madam, until I sleep with you.
But before they reached us–let me say no more!
Oh, no!
Sir, pardon me for what I am about to say.
Let playful people with light hearts dance.
And here comes father.
Please be quiet.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
Good job, my little one.
Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money.
Take away this lout and whip him.
He’ll tell them so.
He’s evaded love once or twice, and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him.
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries.
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.
And I came with him.
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!
Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.
My lord, I swear to you— Oh, don’t swear!
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.
I did, my lord.
You are a rude, ragged nurse and an old, sullen playmate for such tender princes.
He’s subhuman, like an animal.
The rules of dueling say he has to.
You have bested many things, well don’t try and best me.
As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you.
While we were here guarding you as you slept, we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls, or lions.
Be brave and do well!
Here’s the money you asked me to hold.
I cannot blame you now for weeping.
My wife’s coming.
But was this near the shore?
I feel sorry for you.
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.
But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here!
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.
Mine too, to join hers.
Well, we’ll speak more soon.
Go look and then do the talking yourselves.
Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
Leave me alone for a minute.
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
This is just a trifling matter here, sir.
Go.
But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
All right, we’ll have a prologue then.
But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind?
How are you, Malvolio?
That was my turquoise ring!
We need a calendar!
Yes.
One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse.
Where are my good fellows?
We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over.
On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates.
I swear by this hand and my father’s soul, the whole thing is a disaster.
The mayor is here at hand.
This is beyond weird.
Give my answer to them both.
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too.
Oh, forgive all my sins!
Something about Cyprus.
My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.
It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign.
That’s definitely true, my lord.
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.
He’s not telling the truth.
Be quiet, be quiet.
Quiet!
Thank you.
But you’re still my child, my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh, a disease I still have to call my own.
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets.
If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.
He did ask for mercy.
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me!
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do.
What, was I married to her in a dream?
Four o'clock in the morning.
If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.
That’s why you sleep so soundly.
We need some oracle to tell us what’s going on.
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it.
Can you blame him?
It was a bit short, my lord.
That must be because you’re so ambitious.
No, no, no, no!
Good evening, good evening.
I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger.
But, oh, heavenly Rosalind!
How?
Well, then it will be dry.
If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.
Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely.
Hail!
Oh, that arrow was well shot.
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword.
I don’t understand—how should I answer that?
What good luck!
Why “let it strike”?
Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re angels.
Come here, Leonato.
You who are wicked beyond belief, the only “explanation” I’ll accept from you is for you to hang yourself.
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?
Each of you, give me your bloody hand.
Go find the traitor Gloucester.
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.
But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears.
Edmund, go find him.
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion.
It’s almost ten o'clock.
The Turkish navy will be broken up.
Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?
Is it all come to this?
She confessed.
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
It has come again.
So be it.
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.
After you, my lords?
I have no doubt he got ashore alive.
Referee!
By Jesus, he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world.
Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?
Oh, she’s a fine woman!
I’ve acted like such a villain!
She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.
Can he even get angry?
Sneaky, dried-up old coot!
Certainly, I did.
He has, my lord.
What, are you busy?
To whom?
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
You say the king is losing his mind.
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse.
If you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best.
If you’d been as wise as you were bold, With an old man’s mature judgment, You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll.
No, the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever.
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house.
I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck.
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts.
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
Who’s there?  
When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.
Lead those away who will follow you, and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar’s death.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him.
Is it possible?
Where is my mother?
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?
Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
Where is Gloucester?
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Play, I say!
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone!
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it!
And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.
Do as I tell you.
Were you born here in the forest?
They’re pretty busy in there.
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Maybe she can’t find him.
Neither would I.
That’s very strange.
Where’s Antony now?
Tell me that you’ll accept my love.
The heavens are being stingy with their light.
I must go attend Caesar.
Now, no more questions.
Here comes one of them now.
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.
He is an animal worthy of Perseus.
What does the lead box say?
Iago’s a good man.
What do you think, Norfolk?
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.
Listen!
How dare you serve it to me this way!
No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet?
Shall I come down?
Yes, let’s go to sleep.
You’ve got it wrong, old man.
You are welcome here.
Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?
Oh, oh!
Yes, I do.
Hello, good sir.
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously.
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak.
You’ve won.
Don’t you have any brothers like you?
Your words and actions don’t match up.
I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed.
That’s a good one.
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way?
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break.
Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.
He was a wreck, almost past hope.
Don’t bother us up here.
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes.
Absolutely not.
There’d be no work.
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
Am I that name, Iago?
No, my lord, that was me.
It’s the same with men.
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.
I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over!
Yes, right away.
I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.
I’m the man she wants.
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.
Is the single man lucky, then?
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?
Didn’t I tell you she was innocent?
No braver than this?
What do you say?
Your wit is too courtly for me.
Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.
Who talks of my nation?
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.
What does the silver one say?
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Now, daughter Katherine?
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
It’s a trick to confuse us.
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.
Is this true?
Ugly, wrinkled witch, what are you doing here?
I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk, Nerissa.
Farewell, kind master.
It’s Captain Macmorris, right?
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.
Get out of my sight!
It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise.
How are you feeling now?
So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it.
If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.
By this token, you’ll be admitted to their cell.
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.
Go get my best clothes.
No, he’s in a place worse than hell.
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
Where’s America and the West Indies?
It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it.
Just think, I could be Count Malvolio!      
You are only a soldier.
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day.
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.
Oh no!
Yes, do that.
I am their aunt, and I love them like a mother.
Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.
She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.  
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo.
Even their clothes are unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.
Leave me for a bit.
This is a miracle, if you talk of miracles.
Which plays, what music?
How did you get this letter?
Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great?
Claudio!
Goneril with a white beard?
All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows?
God bless you and make you obedient, loving, and kind.  
Don’t refuse it.
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.
Madam, madam— Antony’s dead!
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.
Oh!
In just an hour from now, Duchess of York, I’ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens.
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason.
Good sir, stay close to me.
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak, like women.
Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur.
Your eyes look threatening.
Ah ha!
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
Good-bye.
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing.
Hide her for a while in your house, and tell everyone that she has, in fact, died.
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly.
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped.
What else?
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.
Haven’t you ever heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one away”?
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
You’re  Forgive me, Signior Gremio, but I’m anxious to get things moving.
It’s a disgrace to us all.
Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?
No, I won’t stay a second longer.
And my heart too.
It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?
Shall I put it plainly?
Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.
I don’t think so.
Well, no, not literally.
Are you indeed?
God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you.
He was so sharp when he was in school.
Hello!
Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid might happen.
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
I’m going to make you a rich man.
Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair.
But I surrender all this magic now, when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank.
Then I’ll really give it to you.
The king will be angry with him.
What can I say?
So, if all turns out fine, as you say, it’s more than we deserve or I expect.
I hope that God restores you to health.
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.
I’ll come see you right away.
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.
Look what I have here.
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.
Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it.
Women, dress me like a queen.
Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me.
Bless your heart.
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
We’re here to say “amen” to that.
Why should we do this?
How long has he been possessed like this?
We’re in God’s hands, brother, not in theirs.
If the English had any sense, they would run away.
Yes, they have.
And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.      
Is it on record that he built it, or is it just word of mouth?
Richard loves neither me nor any of you.
I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness.
And it’s all your fault.
Blab my nonsense!
Get up.
Don’t worry about that.
It doesn’t matter.
I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case.
Has he asked for me?
Goodbye.
He’ll be like this for a little while.
Sing us a song.
I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
I’d kiss you before I spoke.
I’m not feeling well—that’s all.
I’m not afraid of dead uncles.
Get out of my face.
Anything.
You mean you don’t even want to hear my side?
Who calls so coldly?
To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame.
What have you heard from her?
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.
Yes, my lord.
Never, my lord.
Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet.
Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself.
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.
He’ll do whatever Hastings does.
Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.
I hope that’s all he loses.
Are you making fun of me?
It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.
Shut the doors after you.
If this letter’s right, you’ve got a lot to deal with.
Which of these bad things happened to him?
murder!
So can I.
What sickness did she die of?
What’s that noise?
These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Greetings, dearest Caesar!
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
I’m a carpenter, sir.
I would, if I had a mirror.
I beg you, remember the good work I’ve done for you, and how I’ve never lied to you, never made mistakes, and never grumbled in my work.
How is she?
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
Struggling with the wind and rain.
I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
I don’t think any woman like that exists.
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?
The word is too good to represent her wickedness.
Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note.
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?
That’s him.
Beware of the devil.
You don’t know my voice?
May the gods bless you.
Well, she got away.
Killing men in the dark?
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold.
Please lock the door and keep quiet.
Listen, listen!
He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him.
But quiet.
Has it come to this?
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.
The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
You’re just playing around.
I’ll be nice to him.
Very nice to see you, sir.
I’m as crazy as he is, if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent.
No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell.
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.
You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid.
Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious.
He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in.
Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.
Heaven help us!
Who’s there?
I don’t trust you.
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon.
Hang on, sir!
Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes.
You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down.
Me too.
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.
What, is trusting a friend such a crime?
If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.
So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio?
I found this pinned to my tent this morning.  
Give me a torch.
Here’s a postscript!.
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter?
I’m only crazy sometimes.
She has been in a man’s bed.
I know you are loyal and honorable.
Well, he’s alive.
Is that why you’re talking so wildly?
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.
Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever.
Will you two help them get ready?
Would your highness like to take a walk?
I don’t understand why she’s not locked up.
I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.
What’s going on, Dromio?
You don’t have a man’s courage.
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court.
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
There’s nothing more.
I swear I am.
Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
I have to stop you, Cimber.
You told me they escaped into this forest.
No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.
Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!
Let go of him, peasant, or you die!
I’m so crazy about you!
Yes, by God!
I myself am the King of Naples, since I saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck.
For my part, I really don’t care.
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
A wonderful miracle!  
As long as that?
Go on.
So now turn and draw your sword.
Who’s that calling so loud?
What’s up, my man?
Welcome, welcome to all of you.
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
Whether your mouth is black or white, Do-dee, dee-dee da.
We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine.
This one, and I will give her to you.
What did he say when he regained consciousness?
Why has all this been put on the table?
Please, just look over there.
Farewell, good neighbor.
Help, help, oh, help!
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!
Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
Come with me; I’ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me.
This messenger is wise.
Don’t stand there shocked.
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?
Bring me his answers quickly.
So let’s see it.
Lead me to where you’re standing.
Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing.
The more she
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house.
Look how she carries on with him!
Now I say good night to your bones, Hero.
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you.
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals.
I’ll do that.    
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can.
Oh, how wonderful to see you!
Certainly, your grandmother had a worse match.
I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me.
Son, I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes.
I was.
What, are you crazy?
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
And like I am for no woman.
And you say he’s not jealous?
I’m very afraid of Banquo.
Yes, it’s Emilia.
It is, my lord.
The fool’s a good actor.
What?
I invite you all aboard my ship.
She speaks my language!
A beautiful voice, I swear.
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.
Come here, good Volumnius.
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Me too.
Oh, right, good Catesby.
My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is.
Where do I live?
Let’s not stay here with them.
You’re tigers, not daughters.
Ouch, what a comeback!
Hey!
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you.
Sad or happy?
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person.
Why have you gotten so rude?
Keep myself?
A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.
How will I recognize you in the future?
And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn.
So I will, my liege.
And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing.
That rotten scoundrel! 
Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
My lord, you know I’m your friend.
Please, master, tell me.
Angry enough to run away.
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?
Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well!
I don’t know what to believe, father.
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Alexas!
He brings great news.
You’re pale and trembling.
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here.
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
By the moon and stars!
There’s another.
My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.
I don’t like it.
But I can’t play a melody.
Do that.
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.
I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world.
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.
What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated?
To die for adultery?
And they’ve been plotting things together.
Leave now.
Tell the army to flee.
Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less.
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet?
Dear son, you’re alive!
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here.
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
I have a favor to ask.
The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.
Oh, heaven help us!
Who’s that?
Shut up.
Kiss him for that, good widow.
Go hang yourselves, all of you!
When he woke, he wouldn’t know where he was.
Of course he is, and so are you.
Charmian!
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned.
Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night.
Go and tell them this.
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last.
Inside, sir, with the earl.
Please have a seat.
Ill will never prompted anything well said.
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.
Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything.
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
Draw your sword, scoundrel.
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
Close, soft eyes.
Did we, my lord?
Whose house?
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
Your brother’s right-hand man.
Things have certainly changed!
I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.
Cassio can have my job.
Really?
Claudio?
What, is the man insane?    
Who’s Thisbe?
No, Antony.
You can figure out the rest.
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill.
All this fighting is because of you.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side.
That light is not daylight, I know it.
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?
How excellent for Antony!
Yes, and be brief.
You’ll be ashamed of this forever!
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails.
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
Yes.
I do hate 
Right on cue.
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
Caesar hanged him for this service.
Don’t ask me anything.
I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.
I am, unless I somehow stole this role.
Let it be.
How goes the battle?
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?
Remember you!
What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop?
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house, to use as bait to catch these thieves.
Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.
If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.
I’ll send my prayers with him.
If it were me, I’d be very upset too.
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
I believe it.
Hey, open the door!
It doesn’t matter.
Give me a cup of wine.
The testament!
Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.
Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves.
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.
Oh!
I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.
Where are they?
I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.
Go relax now.
Were you here when it started?
We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed?
And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
I never hurt you.
That, stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, he’s coming to England to claim the crown.
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
Give it to me!
He received Caesar’s letters, and he is coming.
What support did I have other than Edward?
I’ve heard my father mention him.
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island.
Yes, madam.
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished.
He says he’ll come.
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints.
Then I’ll be quick.
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there.
So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.
Gold, silver, and common lead.
What’s your name?
Your friends at Pomfret, they’re the ones who need a priest.
No, I don’t.
Is that true?
EPHESUS Now what do you think?
You don’t know why we came to visit you— Yes, and so unexpectedly, at night.
Look how they kiss and carry on!
What’s the news?
Master, I’m all tied up for you.
No, that’s the truth.
Come, everyone.
And why, wise lady?
Let me see, let me see.
Don’t tell me that.
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
I won’t mess with him.
Here comes the good Macduff.
I’m dying to see the prince.
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.
We know what’s appropriate for a watch.
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
You’ll know more about it later.
That’s always true.
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
And women.
Didn’t feel like it?
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food.
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.
If this logic works, that’s great.
I am his brother, and I love him very much.
I have no opinion about him.
Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.
Didn’t I meet up with your allies?
Did you mention that Edward’s children are bastards?
Here, Peter Quince.
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.
He would never have spoken to me like this.
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done.
Your majesty!
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
What’s your name?
Isn’t that him heading this way?
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?
What are you reading, teacher?
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine, but when he touches them, they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven.
No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
I recognize his walk.
Come on, let’s go inside.
But here comes Antony.
Are we all ready?
My good lord, I still need you to like me.
You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear.
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.
I don’t know you.
What handkerchief?
Who’s that calling?
Go on, get out of here.
But surely you’re not planning to 
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian?
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.
I grow old, and all dignity has been thrashed out of me.
We’ll outwit them all—that old geezer, Gremio; the suspicious father, Minola; the prim musician lover, Litio—all for the sake of my master, Lucentio.
You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?
I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away.
Just as Antony loves.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?
I mean please go into the house, sir.
If that means I don’t care about anything, you should disappear right now, since you’re nothing.
I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning.
Monster, I’ll kill this man.
And now you’re asking for money.
Come on, be a man.
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles?
Let’s be disciplined and not delay, because tomorrow is a busy day.
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa?
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.
Tomorrow’s a good day.
You’re competing for
Someone else has the same name, but he’s a better man.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Let’s listen to the moon.
Will you abandon her?
Give me the letter.
What do you want to say, sir?
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!
I remember this fellow—he once played the eldest son of a farmer.
How much does he owe the Jew?
Welcome, my lord.
What does it matter?
Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts.
What was your dream?
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?
But what’s your trade?
He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine.
Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester.
How do you know?
She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first!
I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago.
Please, write down “Borachio.”—And yours?
What would you have said, my young York?
I should have waited to tell you my news.
For assuredly, you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up.
What did Northumberland say about Richmond?
For God’s sake, would someone bring me a mug of beer!
So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?
But brother Anthony— Don’t, it’s no big deal.
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
Well, good-bye, Portia.
Why the hell did you come in between us?
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee.
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions.
Do you dare kill a friend of mine?
I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery.
Then certain ones.
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me.
You’re helping the storm, not us.
Why, what are you afraid of?
You got me, I admit it.
I think it is, sir.
Oh ho!
We are, my lord.
Stay in the dark.
I think this night is just like sick daylight.
I agree— Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious.
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.
Don’t be afraid.
Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?
But what about the bloody handkerchief?
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light.
The table is full on both sides.
Be patient.
Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.
By this sword, I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust.
Why, what’s the danger?
By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics.
Who brought it out here?
Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me.
Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.
What?
Where are your tenants and your followers?
Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?
I need to get Othello’s things from the ship.
Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!
I don’t like her name.
Captain Macmorris, when we have more leisure, see, I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare, and that’s that.
My man—monster is so drunk he can’t talk.
A woman should always pick an older man.
But please tell me more.
I order you to come with me.
It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body.
You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner.
But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it.
He is, my lord.
Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to!
No, not at all.
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will.
No we’re not—it’s night.
What do you think you’re doing?
Oh, shut up!
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
What do you say?
He’ll wake you up, I bet.
If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands.
Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.
I’ll have none of your money.
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.
I’m starting to feel murderous urges.
I’m not Cinna the conspirator.
The will!
Did you hear the news that’s going around?
I’ll be there early.
Insolent  Oh, the good gods!
Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
He followed you.
Naked,” he says.
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower.
I’m not holding your hand, sir.
He was dressed so oddly too!
Do you want to sleep?
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword.
This fellow will out-talk us all.
You give your best praise to the worst women.
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
Don’t go out today.
He’s afraid to come in.
If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I won’t spend tonight in this town.
Something’s wrong.
I’m dying for food, so let me have some.
I’m your neighbor and came courting first.
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.
Where is Duncan’s body?
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished.
Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.
Though I wish you were dead, I’m not going to be the one to kill you.
Sirs, take up the corpse.
Get out, you horrible poison.
Heaven knows I am.
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment.
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
Get going already.
Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly.
I’m hoping my holy mood will pass.
I tell you, you’ve ruined her gown.
Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it.
And harm is getting close!
Blow the trumpet!
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind?
Lend me your cloak, Sir Thomas.
The French have reinforced their scattered men.
I think I do.
He thinks highly of me.
How will we pass the time without some entertainment?    
The enemy’s losses have been very great, pretty substantial.
The wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs remain.
You imply that married men are fools.
If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.
Why would you do that, my love?
Did you say Cassio?
Please, don’t take it badly, but I cannot and will not give in to you.
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together.
Oh, really?
Stay, lovely Helena.
No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions.
Good night.
Again!
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.
You mean “paragon.” A  The duke’s leaving the temple.
He’s dead.
Do you want to sink?
You’ll take the mustard or you’ll get no beef from Grumio.
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.
Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.
Has the storm passed?
What’s this!
And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
That doesn’t matter.
Your son is crazy.
No doubt, but you may be going about it the wrong way—Neighbor, this gift is very gracious, I’m sure.
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?
First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand.
But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him.
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
Don’t laugh at me, but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia.
Thank God, thank God!
Did he confess?
I mean, what sort of man is he?
But don’t I have good reason to cry?
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.
Otherwise—forgive me, but if you should die before him, what becomes of her dowry?
Are you down in the dumps?
Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
Where are the thousand 
Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields.
You sell fish.
Will you take me, my lady?
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise.
How can that be?
Cheer up and be at peace.
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.
Oh, how I love you!
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.
May heaven bless you.
We’ve advanced too far.
Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes.
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
I haven’t done anything wrong.
Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.
No, sir.
But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him.
You’re my lieutenant now.
Whom you swore you would protect and defend.
I’m not sorry, either.
I’m your love, no matter what you think.
Yes, we talked for a couple of hours.
They’re coming.
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument.
But I don’t have any good sides.
It’s true.
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.
I defy brain-death!
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
I’m afraid it will make you too hot, too.
Here, hang them on this clothesline.
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
It’s midnight.
I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
Not yet.
I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt.
Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex, with such a father and such a husband?
How tragic!
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.
Oh painful, painful, painful day!
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
Did you just call me “beautiful”?
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
Oh, damn, damn, damn!
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe.
You’ve heard a lot.
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
He’s already done so.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.
You know where she is.
I’ll give it back to you.
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.
The count’s messenger, Cesario.
Here, my good lord.
He has come to kill my heart.
Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?  
Yeah, that would get every single one of us executed.
Why do you say that?
If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.
Le Roy?
Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.
Here comes the little villain herself.
Everyone who can hear has heard about it.
If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words.
Yes, Lepidus.
Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment.
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt?
This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me.
My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.
Their names are marked.
Let him thank me, who helped him get there.
Excuse me, weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now?
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
Let’s play billiards.
Then tomorrow we’ll find that they feel only like eating, not like fighting.
Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are.
Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?
It’s so scary to look down!
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy!
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered.
It’s still a long time until daybreak.
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s me, it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house.
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive?
That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.
Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband?
Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head?
Sadness and despair!
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him.
We’re to be married on Sunday.
This is some monster of the island, with four legs, who seems to me to have some kind of ache.
Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s.
What fate is that?
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
You ass!
I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.
They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins.
You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.
Come like shadows and depart in the same way!
Why are you acting so angry?
Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.
Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont.
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.    
I’ve got something for you.
But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not.
Are you there?
Good morning to all these lovely people.
I’ll think it over.
Oh, please do.
What are you saying, Cordelia?
Look how lush and healthy the grass is!
I won’t take it.
Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration.
It’s not manly to cry.
There, Diomedes, there.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Where are you going?
Disgusting!
Now heaven has her.
Caesar, the clock has struck eight.
The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.
It’ll be worth your while.
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.
You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands.
Then meet me right away at the notary’s.
Monster, use your fingers.
What’s going on, my lord?
What about Stanley?
Oh, what a sad sight!
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger, dear Captain Blunt, say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note.
Go, get out!
My cousin Westmoreland?
Why not?
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.
Yes, ma'am.
Farewell, hostess.
It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive.
Who has wronged him?
But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention.
Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly.
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?
Here, take this piece of jewelry.
But is he often like this?
I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen.
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.
Who treated you badly?
I’m telling you, your husband.
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.
Understand?
To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus.
I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can.
Do you work in this house?
Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.
Will you, Strato?
Priest.
I’m sorry, my friend.
I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see.
Very pale, sir.
They howl about banishment.
I’ll go to the right side.
Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
I needn’t be ashamed of your Majesty, God be praised, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
Thank you, sir.
Eros, can you still see me?
Do you have anything else to say?
Don’t worry, I won’t.
A man old Frederick, your father, loves.
I wish you were someone else’s son.
But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife.
Murder?
All the spirits hate him as much as I do.
Leave me, my friend.
Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.
Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.
Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks.
And then what would I do with him?
Is he really married?
I give you my obedience and my humble service, madam.
Which ones are the malefactors?
Has it come to this?
Stay inside.
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours?
This is the final discussion I will grant.
Is your name Goneril?
But that’s just a fairy tale.
Which one of you is Beatrice?
Is it gone?
Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood.
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
No, he’s a devil—a devil, I tell you!
But you had better get back to Egypt again.
To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line.
The man’s going crazy.
If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away.
And anything else?
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
How  What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here.
I know that, sir.
If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding.
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.
Ugh!
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying.
Swaggering?
Asses are made for bearing, and so are you.
You see how the world goes, Volumnius.
Then a third of the world is drunk.
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter.
Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
It’s dinnertime, my lord.
Divine, perfect woman, give me a chance to prove in detail that I’m innocent of the evils you accuse me of.
No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her.
Terrible.
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason.
It would be hard, almost impossible.
Then I rebel against you, stars!
How is my noble lord?
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out.
Do you know him?
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot; Sir William Stanley; Oxford; the highly feared Pembroke; Sir James Blunt; Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; and many other famous and powerful noblemen.
I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground.
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing.
Please don’t play games.
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it.
I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town.
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here, because he’s clearly disturbed.
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  You’re being arrested?
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.
Sometimes I’ll turn into fire!
You’re kidding!
You can go straight to hell!
I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much.
Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything.
Shame on Romeo!
Yes, my lord.
What do you want from me?
You left him out in the storm in the black night, bareheaded, a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea, the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars.
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling.
No.
On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight.
I definitely will.
I hope to God Othello’s all right.
Noble words, sir.
Please don’t cry.
Yes, fashion is fashion.
Wake up, I say!
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
We’ll see about that!
Say goodbye to your sisters.
I’m done for.
But you have to.
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
Are you going riding this afternoon?
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Where are you going?
What’s my name?
Around nine o'clock, madam.
Are you squinting at me?
It’s absurd.
The duke of Gloucester, who has command over the siege, is in consultation with an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman indeed.
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, see, of my mind, with respect to the demands of proper military practice—that’s the point?
You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew.
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great 
Don’t you hear it ring?
God save the king!
We have to go out and talk to them.
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt.
You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus.
Tell me, you unknown power— He can read your thoughts.
Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.
You certainly deserve it.
Down with the Montagues!
And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio, Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina.
You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius.
Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.
I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker.
I’m completely lost.
Oh, it’s a disaster, a disaster, by this hand, it’s a disaster.
Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way?
I’ll go with you.
It is.
I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good.
Stop, brave lady, stop!
But Count Claudio can stay, for what I’m about to say concerns him.
What country is this, friends?
Venus went home again, and her little son broke all his arrows, swearing he’ll never shoot them again, but play with birds like other little boys.
I’m not well.
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
Not even one success?
None of us.
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion.
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
You do Stay, Please, tell me what you think of me.
My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy.
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way.
It’s half of all my money.
What kind of man are you?
Yes.
Something there isn’t a word for.
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
But don’t delay.
Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.
I’ll pay you.
Do you think it would work?
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to.
Who’s there?
I know her by her walk.
It’s wrong for the duke to do this.
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run.
Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity.
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us.
Why, then, it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops. 
Call it a match!
Leave her to God and her own guilt.
There has never been so black a day as today.
But come on, start.
I can’t recall where I slept last night.
The Jew will have justice.
You can’t party your way into dukedoms there.
What a horrible slut!
Yes, madam.
Thank you.
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
You were sent for.
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
Good Enobarbus!
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed.
The villain won’t escape.
Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly.
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
If you don’t mind, I need to rest a bit.
What, we’re going to die?
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse.
Poison never came from such a sweet place.
If you leave me like this, you’re doing me wrong.
Don’t put me in the stocks.
Farewell till then.
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
Who’s talking to him now?
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
Pull them apart.
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
If you say that, you’ll only be telling the truth.
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.
They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately.
My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.
Must I bite?
Look, how she blushes like a virgin!
Do I ask you to follow me?
I can’t sleep quietly in the Tower.
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
Do you mean the king?
He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos.
Who does he accuse?
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
I’ll put her on that.
Let’s act quickly.
Orsino.
Call that servant back.
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants?
If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.
I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker.
Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood.
Plantagenet.
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time.
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
I saw it with my own eyes.
What is there left to do?
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am.
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve.
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
Get it ready immediately.
There’s nothing else.
Yes, boy.
Who are you talking about, niece?
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
No, absolutely not.
But don’t keep wondering without more proof.
Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.
Eyes, look out for the last time!
Your wife, sir, your wife.
So they think it’s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment—two strong preventive medicines that foster long life.
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
Let me be put to death.
Come, bring me to them.
Go!
The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it.
For three months, hmmm.
No.
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.
He may command me as my king, but you still have power over me as a relative.
The ground is brown.
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns.
Even my tears burn me like molten lead.
Here.
Yes, my lord.
Come with me to see the duchess.
I’ll shut up now.
My fears can’t actually make you evil.
Indeed, sir, it is.
For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
Go now and get cash.
Tell me, friend.
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it.
Get the lady out of here.
They certainly do like to butt heads!
What’s that?
Go look for him.
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
Lock the doors.
He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet.
Why?
You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.
Yes, very much like a whale.
Please smile whenever you’re near me, my dearest darling.”
But the enemy is loud.
Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready.
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.
Look behind you, my lord.
If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence.
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you.
I’ve outshot you, and not for the first time.
Pile of dirt!
My lord, what do you want?
Therefore, you should obey their wishes.
My countrymen— Silence!
Ah, soldier!
Yes, and his relative, too.
Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand.
Where is his body, Messala?
Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away.
Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself.
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing.
Your daughter and son-in-law.
March to the bridge.
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.
Where have  Come here, boy.
The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the contract.
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I understand now.
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this.
There’s a spirit in here!
Come with me and let me advise you.
Yes, my lord, if you would like.
Amen.
Then there’s still a chance.
Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here.
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Don’t worry about me.
It’s strange that you haven’t heard.
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
What a man, young lady.
Help!
What disease is he talking about?
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again.
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
You may really be honest, no matter what I think.
It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil.
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
How are you, your highness?
I’m leaving now.
For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror.
Yes.
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love?
I think you’re more articulate.
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government.
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses.
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead.
Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely.
Hello, everyone!
This is my treasurer.
What’s going on here, you secret, evil, midnight hags?
The whole world wants her.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
You will, my lord.
They plan to spend the night in Sardis.
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong, gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber, and weep into the river until it overflows its banks.
No, I don’t, sir.
Come, Kate, let’s go to bed.
Two or three men, my lord, who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England.
Call in my maid.
Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is waiting for us at the gate.
I found them on a tree.
I want my bond.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Now it’s time to get your costumes together.
God should keep me from false friends, but they weren’t false.
How is your Highness?
We’ll hurry.
My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor.
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.
Nothing?
Look and see.
Let’s give a fair verdict.
I know who you are.
I know he’s noble, rich, young, and with a fine reputation.
Oh, what a sad day!
Me, ma'am?
Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again.
Call him.
We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.
We already knew that.
I’ll help you.
Monstrous!
Your love’s name is Rosalind?
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him, and I laughed and refused to flee with him.
No thank you, my lord.
What else?
Are you crazy?
Don’t look so sour.
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.
I can’t speak any more. 
Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person.
A horse, a horse, I’d give my kingdom for a horse!
And hello to you, fair sister.
Why do you want to do that, my lord?
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.
Indeed, the enemy nearly took the bridge, but he was forced to retreat, and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge.
Oh, your contemptible lady!
Beat him up.
Thank you, I’m sure.
If the other two are as loopy as we are, our country’s in bad shape.
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules.
What does he say about Brutus?
It has no fighting spirit.
Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king?
What?
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
Now, Iras, what do you think?
Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that.
You will be the king.
Oh angels, protect us!
Won’t he join us?
As for the rest of the ships, I scattered them, and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean, sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king.
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.
Look, here comes the fool.
Take my sword.
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.
Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.
Please say no more.
Your life is stretched to its limit.
Show.
He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens.
It’s good we had this meeting.
Me too, I swear.
Let’s not leave him out.
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.
Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at?
This way, my lord.
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now.
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?
I’m ready.  
What would you do about it?
No, my dear cousin.
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.
What’s the matter?
Sit down, Jessica.
Follow my mother.
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I, though they don’t cry for Edward, as I do.
We’ll talk about this later.
Passionate”?
I’ll go, sir, and I won’t bother you.
Or had a friend who would be a man for me!
Here.
He’s done wrong, and his master the king will punish him for it.
Yes, you did.
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate.
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin.
Where’s my father?
Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.
My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.
Go on, wear your boots out!
Are they likely to get dusty?
If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?
A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it.
Your mother’s name has become a threat to her own children.
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on our trip home.
I hope so too, Madam.
Caesar was a tyrant.
Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable.
She’s ready to go, but she’ll never return. 
This is pure insanity.
You know why I think so?
Did he stare at you?
Tranio, I think I’ve got it!
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
Have courage, man.
Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father?
Get over it.
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels.
All right.
He doesn’t have any daughters, sir.
In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me.
I’ve been here too long.
Oh, that’s a good wish!
You’re overstepping your bounds now.
No, and she swears she never will.
Yes, yes!
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
What’s the news with you?
Anyway, how are you, Jessica?
So she was moved by it?
The thing is definitely going to be sold.
Let George Stanley die after the battle.
Are you a man?
But I’ll stop rebuking you.
As you wish, sir.
At other times, I know what’s what.
The poor people died.
Here.
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.
I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends.
Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
I’ll be right here, silent.
Come out, I order you.
Well, well.
Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context.
Help me, help me!
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
Yes, I’ll grant you that.
At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal.
Where’s the necklace?
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.
Should we all give up and drown?
Well then, I’ll do it.
How is she?
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.
Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you.
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
My own flesh and blood turned against me!
She says you’re going to marry her.
Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
I don’t
God say, “Amen”!
Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi.
I’m glad to see your highness.
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
What shall I do?
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife.
Yes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan and his fine son too.
Bad times?
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
Battered armor, be off.
Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.
Which one is Sebastian?
Ah, he got you back, Benedick!
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other.
Brutus, what will we do?
Well, we’ll stop, then.
I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous.
Oh no!
Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit?
Bridegroom?
So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned.
Apparently so.—Cover their faces.
I am not treacherous.
What other rites are you going to give her?
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications.
Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
Come on!
My grandmother told me he was murdered there.
What’s the difference?
You look like a person who knows the business of war.
If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!
I’m telling you, it’s hers.
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.
What right did he have to scold me like that?
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia.
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky.
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
Is this the Prince?
My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim.
Nothing, my lord.
Somebody’s knocking.
Your worst fault is being in love.
All right.
What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
Night is over, and day is coming.
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.
No, who are you talking about?
What do you think, Bottom?
You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.
Hey, bride!
Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?
My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive.
What?
What do you need me to do?
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress.
It’s getting late.
That’s what he says.
But you heard him swear up and down that he was.
Ratcliffe!
What can you swear by now?
I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm.
Shall we not?
Let me deal with this.
I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife.
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
Beware of jealousy, my lord!
Claudio!
Listen, listen!
This may end without anyone getting killed. 
And he told us to follow him to the temple.
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
You have impatience all over your face.
And what about him, Tranio?
I know him; he wears a lock of hair.
I want to head out tonight.
I can’t believe you’re my son.
Get out of here!
There must be something in the air here.
Look, Don Pedro has come back for you.
Oh, I’m talking too loud.—Where’s Malvolio?
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
He was dressed like a hunter.
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair.
You have no reason to say that.
Do you want to get married, fool?
My father wasn’t a traitor.
Me neither, my lord.
Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen!
If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter.
Ah, here she comes, angry and sad.
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace.
So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases.
Please rise, Queen.
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where.
But, uncle, you know how to bear with him.
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
If only I could somehow relate them to me!
That’s an oath of great power, and our fury must subside.
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!
There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony.
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too.
Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve.
What’s going on?
I won’t be hit, my lord.  
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it.
When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish.
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France.
It’s a big prize for such a small sin.
And Rosencrantz!
I know you have no choice.
The man should be inside the lantern.
Take a trumpet, herald.
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same.
Let me go with you to Belmont.
But mistress, know yourself.
Well, the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer.
Yes, I do, lady.
I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you.
I pity your situation.
Yes, dear madam.
Look how she rubs her hands.
Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.
Oh, noise?
Listen to me, Queen.
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers?
Don’t come again to ask for my ransom, good messenger.
Thank you, sir.
You thug!
Who are the actors?
No.
Please don’t make fun of me.
Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence?
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock.
Because it doesn’t have eight?
I told him you were sick.
Lepidus is red in the face.
What would that be?
But by the grace of God, she’s mine.
As sane as me?
I said you had a fine wit.
Yes, your Highness.
No, not at all.
Carry them away.
What have you done?
The queen and her elves will be here soon.
We need more help!
Hey!
What do you mean, “wears the wreath”?
Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige.
This looks like an abbey.
What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later.
Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.      
Let’s follow him.
Where are my slippers?
Go to the gate.
All to our advantage.
Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need.
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart.
There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love.
I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy.
Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.
But where’s the money?
Stand still.
No lie—she screamed at you.
What’s the matter?
I’m wounded.
As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right.
He’s not wise enough to be brave.
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
Not true.
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.
Your superiors.
He’s calling us back.
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.
From soldiers.
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.
About as old as you are, my lord.
No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed.
Ah, but I know you.
You’ve offered an excellent interpretation.
That’s just how he is.
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated.
Fool, speak well of yourself.
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
How the hell does he know our language?
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.
If he agrees, great.
Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
Nobody like that should be trusted.
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir— What’s your point?
And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.
I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass.
Put the torch out, so I can’t be seen.
Amen!
So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much.
Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?!
Portia, goodbye to you.
I’ll disguise myself in somber robes.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness deserves thanks.
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
Let me go with him.
They were villains, murderers.
I’m your master, Dromio.
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Oh, that’s nonsense!
Let me ask you something in private.
Those who have done this deed are honorable.
His most horrible murder.
And you won’t tell me who you are?
The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering.
What could I say, my dear?
Are you really as in love as your poems declare?
Usually that means a person is foolish.
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
Look, let’s stay here tonight.
Not now.
What are you saying?
I’ll obey you until I can make bail.
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
Explain, boy.
How could he be in debt without me knowing it?
If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant.
If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.
Of all places, I don’t like the 
But I’m running ahead of myself.
Do you maintain the same story?
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
Yes, my master.
Let’s go!
Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena.
Good morning to both of you.
Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain!
Help us, good friends.
Oh, oh, oh!
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.
It persuades you and discourages you.
Round enough to be unattractive.
Strange things are about to happen, Edmund.
If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines.
What kind of loyalty is this?
Does that mean he’s lazy?
Sirs, I ask you to sleep in my tent.
We have to think about that.
No.
Play with me, Charmian.
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.
The muffled queen” is good.
You’re bleeding a lot.
If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.
Is there more work to do?
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
But how long will her beautiful life last?
Now, by the world— It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness.
That’s him.
Why do you ask?
If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.
Did you see anything?
Then the Jew must show you mercy.
I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
Come on, sister.
Are you satisfied, Jew?
Why, friends, you don’t even know what you’re doing yet.
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on.
Take your cues from my own despair.
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.
Goodbye.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.
Let’s go, Tom.
You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age.
The king of Naples, my arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him, would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead.
Come, explain.
Damn it, this isn’t funny.
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.
I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny.
Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you.
That’s a Cornish name.
That is a certain truth.
His breath stinks.
Farewell, old man.
There’s little or nothing of that.
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
Take away this body, and do what I say.
Is that true, my lords of England?
Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons.
And still do, I swear by my hands.
You don’t have to go yet.
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands.
There is no better one on earth.
I have to go.
I assure you, sir, the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below.
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
The noise is coming from over there.
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
My lord?
I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.
Honestly, sir, we say that we are not criminals.
Read it, great Caesar.
Enough, gentlemen.
They are full of pity for Caesar.
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio.
Caesar?
The queen is dead, my lord.
I’ll get free of you.
And here he is.
Goodbye.
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.
Whatever you want—I made it for you.
Yes, if I’m still alive, and you’re still sane, and your dinner is worth eating.
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight.
Do you know Captain Gower?
Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable.
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol.
Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper.
Here I am.
He’s a conspirator.
That’s my sister.
Nonsense!
But back to that argument you mentioned.
That’s not the tune I had in mind.
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?
When you are gentle, you shall have one, too, and not till then.
He would have?
A mature age.
She’s obedient—a fine lady.
Now, sir, where is Claudio?
You have some plea for Caesar, don’t you?
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!
I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.
There’s a ransom.
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
When he wakes up!
Please, do so.
Oh, come on, woman.
Enough.
Cassio’s not dead?
And I love Hastings with all my heart.
But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded.
She’s wise, if I’m judging her right.
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.
If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.
Very true.
Admit you were wrong.
I’ll take comfort in my books and music, reading and practicing my instruments.
Good friends, I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient, sweet, virtuous wife.
Good day to both of you.
Are you talking about the crown?
How are you, Sir Toby Belch?
Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.
God have mercy on us!
What’s the matter?
I’m afraid he’ll punish me.
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?
Three thousand ducats.
Here comes the Duke now.
And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge?
I’ve found it out.
I won’t deny you anything!
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.
Please forgive me, master.
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever.
Claim fair England’s peace depends on this alliance.
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear.
Come, Vaughan.
I don’t know that, once he knows what I know.
So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
It’s already almost night.
All these friends are my witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself reflected— Did you hear that!
Why have you come here in such a mob?
Please, don’t mention her.
Beat the drum.
But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
I wish he’d go away!
Merciful God!
Oh, my lady, I’m ashamed to admit it.
He’s a good soldier too, lady.
You’re all lazy and shallow.
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
Leave them alone, and do the murder first.
Let’s go there.
I bet you’re a happy fellow who doesn’t care about anything.
This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in.
In my bedroom window there is a book.
Caesar’s speed defies belief.
Don’t you think you should go to bed, Malvolio?
You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.
You’ve already done something you should be sorry for.
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
Calphurnia!
Thieves!
It’s pointless to talk now.
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.
I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain!
Oh noble lord, consider your lineage.
Can you smell out his secret now?
What’s your name, friend?
Don’t ask me to talk about it.
She says she thinks this is a prank.
He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy.
As a friend or an enemy?
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
I’ll be off before you are.
Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
Antonio!
A rebel!
Wind and rain can’t wash it off.
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back.
And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia.
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.
I told him what I thought.
Why are you crying?
I don’t understand why they’re all here together.
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman.
Let me sit down.
Don’t go,” says my conscience.
So, good-bye.
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.
Do you want my true opinion?
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least.
We’re all waiting for the revenge!  
Amen to that!
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
Enough!
Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there.
No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had.
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves.
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.
God has blessed you with a good name.
Oh, for Pete’s sake!
Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you.
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully.
That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.
We can all go together.
You mean the man who used to be Othello?
Our troops are deployed tomorrow.
I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir.
What is it, Octavia?
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.
Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Thanks, good Egeus.
Let them in.
The things that threaten me have only seen my back.
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries.
This is a small house.
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy, then be happy, because I did it.
No, of course you don’t.
He’s going after a young widow.
Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now.
What have you done?
That’s excellent.
They say they have letters for you.
Take him to the surgeons.
I have a good eye, uncle.
But oh, how odd it is to have to ask for my child’s forgiveness!
What a fearful night this is!
What’s the matter?
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.
No, before!
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home.
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out looking brand-new.
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you.
Now, let it work.
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir.
His letter’s going to be hilarious.
Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.
Farewell.
Stop right now!
Yes, that’s it!
Listen up, you slave.
Why did I just send you home?
How are you doing, Stephano?
Please wait, sir.
Remember what I’ve told you.
In that case, I don’t much care for you either.
I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss.
I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other.
I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.
Good Captain Blunt, tell the earl goodnight from me, and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent.
What kind of crude jerk are you?
Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.
Cassio’s been wounded.
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
He’s an admirable man.
You stole it from her?
You can’t mean what you’re saying.
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves, or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men?
I don’t know, except they are busy with some phony guarantee.
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen, and what you deserve is to act like my subjects.
He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you.
Be patient, sir!
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
Mantua.
It’s him!
Have you heard this, Cassio?
Thanks, my dear lord.
No, he was wicked and vile.
Get out of my sight.
No, we’ll all go there to bring him.
I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining.
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service.
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags?
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you.
What are you going to do?
There’s no masquerade tonight.
If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company?
In that case you should sleep.
He told us to arrange it.
You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will.
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.
In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.
You are not, Cassius.
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.
He’ll tell you more of the story.
Murder, murder!
Could you tell me how near the enemy is?
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?
Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
So I welcome this wind freely.
He’s eager to see your head.
If I default, he’ll pay you.
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.
Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.
And to hell with drowning yourself!
Get me out of here!
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
A Roman.
Why do you look so upset?
They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country.
Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was the fairest creature in the world—and even now she has no equal.
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.
Go forward.
Which of us are you referring to?
Tell me your idea first.
By God, I order you to speak.
I hope he’s in love.
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
Well, that’s what he’s doing—making you free to enjoy heaven.
Here, Fluellen, stick this in your cap.
I’ve said too much in telling you of it.
How about the mustard without the beef.
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.
Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you.
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
Romans, countrymen, and friends!
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
Until then, God be with you!
There’s plenty of time.
From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears.
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses, who are beside themselves with fear.
I’ll take responsibility for it.
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
I will, my liege.
What should we say, my lord?
Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
Or any of you?
And what are you going to do with it?
If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately.
Let me see it.
More, please, more.
Are you kidding?
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there.
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?
Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?
Good luck, sir.
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate, and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover, where they claim to have powerful friends.
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her.
Oh, that’s pathetic!
Amen.
I’d rather go without the money.
He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.
What’s there to say?
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief.
Give me another horse!
No, it’s certain, Iras.
Wake up, wake up!
That’s right, you stupid thing.
Good morning, Kate, for I hear that’s what you’re called.
Good morning, Catesby.
I don’t deny it.
Your father!
Come, why be so hesitant?
I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through,
You know, you’re right.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.
If you would have such a man, take me.
I’ll get your goats, Audrey.
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
Where’s your servant 
No, my good lord.
There’s magic in its fabric.
And Cassio’s killed?
Clever lies.
Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this, things that I can’t remember.
Come on, you’re drunk.
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again.
I tell you, they are not honest men.
This is as rude as it is strange.
If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him.
Look at me now!
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax, stooped over with old age and ill will?
What’s the obvious conclusion from that?
I told you not to hang around my house.
And I am, I am.
Who can prosecute me for it?
Yes, my lord.
Nothing, sir, except grandchildren.
How else is he the “man in the moon”?
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
Do you acknowledge the contract?
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
Don’t talk to me, Emilia.
Come, let’s go to the dance.
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago.
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse.
Lady!
What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?
So why aren’t our eyelids heavy?
No, advancement to the dignity and height of honor, to a high, imperial kind of glory.
There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Away!
Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping.
If you regard it as shameful, put the shame on me.
And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave.
It’s Casca—I know your voice.
Though we have lost a generous king, we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king.
Dear master, listen to me.
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.
I will my lord, as fast as I can.
I beg the court to deliver the verdict.
I’ll read it.—It looks so unlike Portia!
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same.
Please, dear, calm down.
Paying debts is for peasants.
We just want you to answer to your real name.
This is unbelievable!
Oh, poor Romeo!
Are you in your right mind?
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me.
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
Birnam Wood.
Only my free will—nothing else.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend 
Come this way, my lord.
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
That light we see is coming from my hall.
My name is Decretus.
He saved me the trouble: here he comes.
Who was it that came here?
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.
The king and the prince are praying.
Thursday it is, then. 
Well then.
Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul.
I’ll do that.
Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to?
More shouting!
Is he right?
I must tell you then.
I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her prisoner with the force of my love story.
These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it.
That’s what’s clever about it.
In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.
My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time.
What was it?
Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.
Are you?
I don’t know what “poetical” means.
Call to him, Mercutio.
He is like a god and knows the truth.
Horatio, tell me something.
If you want to watch, follow me.
Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved.
How are you doing, Charles?
If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us.
I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less.
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now.
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy.
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me.
By this sword, I will.
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.
Hardly, Kate.
They’re on the march.
Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me.
I never offended him at all.
You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to.
I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened.
The skin is good for your cracked head.
You and he are both welcome, sir.
Why, no, boy.
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.
Our men have all broken ranks.
I drink to you.
I’ll call for you soon.
I’d rather get a husband from your father.
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?
Name one.
I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
Before you make  My lord, you could really help me out now.
God bless you, my friend, and your music too.
Have patience and endure.
If I could colonize this island, my lord— He’d cultivate weeds on it.
What’s the matter?
Is it a weakness?
What, even you, Brutus?
What are you going to do now?
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
But try to control your speech.
That’s true.
Is it possible?
In England this strange monster would be just like a man.
Yes, if your memories do you no good.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Play some music while he chooses.
Let me come clean.
You haven’t seen him since?
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.
My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice!
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it.
If you remember your life before you came here, you may also remember how you got here.
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.
Will you cry?
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house?
Look, he’s approaching Caesar.
Where is our entertainment director?
I wish I were in an alehouse in London!
So, to answer your question.
I’ll do my best to make this lady love you.
What a tedious wait!
Yes, of course.
Let’s have one, good soldier.
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
It starts, “Shut up.” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.
No, my lord.
There, my lord.
Think about that, and about what followed afterward.
If you ever had a mother, come in quickly to Sir John.
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
I beg your pardon, sir— What did that guy say?
I assure you, sir, it’s true.
No, because my manly heart is grieving.
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom.
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
Listen but don’t speak to it.
Or thorn-bushes.
Go back to your lord.
An awful monster!
Off!
The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds.
You’re torturing me, Tubal.
But, hang on!
I feel tortured by all this talking.
Take up the body.
Do you like me, Kate?
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to.
Not for your entire fairy kingdom.—Come, fairies, let’s go.
But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing.
Beat them down!
I’ll give my life for you, just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you.
If not, he’s got truth on his side!
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with.
Call the priest.
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes!
I know what you’d do.
You’re in a hurry, are you?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily.
I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.
It’s a strange snake.
Why are you enraged?
Who I am and what I want are a secret.
Curse you!
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!
Jailer, watch out for this one.
This is your job.
All three of us will marry now in death.
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!
Royal seductress!
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
Gentlemen, let go of him.
What’s wrong with my niece?
Dead.
No, wait.
Goodbye.
So I can eat lunch.
Give it to my wife, and get your money.
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
Is my ink and paper ready?
God will take revenge.
That?
That’s true.
Drawing your sword on a woman?
And like I am for Rosalind.
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.
In any case, do what you want.
I could go around the world in forty minutes.
She would make a good wife for Benedick.
Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit.
Are you speaking from your heart?
I hope you sleep peacefully.
Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father?
My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.
And servants of the Danish king.
I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind.
In the meantime, think about how I can do you good and give you what you want.
What do you think I should do?
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.
I like him very well.
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin?
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.
Dear woman, you don’t know the rules of charity.
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.
No, don’t pause, because I 
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown.
Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail.
You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto.
With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.
No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about.
She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.
I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.
I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
Oh, look, sir, look, sir!
There is no life, but my love is dead!
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
Give me your hand, Messala.
The generals want to speak with us.
As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it.
It’s like a cannon.
So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense.
What, is today a holiday?
If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week.
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly!
There are parents living whose children you have butchered; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old.
So we should eat and drink.
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France.
And if they don’t find charity there, they find it someplace else.
Discipline must be kept.
He doesn’t have children.
Can you bring me to him?
No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.
They swore you did.
Go to the church.
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman.
What’s the matter?
Alas, you misunderstood everything!
I didn’t survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now.
This toast is for Lepidus!
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that?
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs.
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.
Take it easy!
Now is the time when we need your help.
But listen to me, Gratiano.
Look, my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him.
May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering.
What is your news?
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?
Then no man has ever been honest.
I’m ordering you, go home.
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
If he stays in this country he’ll be found.
He’s a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.
It’s true, my lords, he did.
I’d rather have my horse than a mistress.
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed, for my horse is my mistress.
Now go find the forest ranger.
That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to accomplish it.
Why not!
Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win.
Past noon.
Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it.
Then let the rain come down.
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly.
So young, my lord, and honest.
Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict?
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
I don’t know.
For lead?
Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
What have you found out?
Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur.
When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long.
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine.
And also to find out the size of the enemy army.
Myself?
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.
I don’t trust you.
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
He’s got my vote as I die.
Mark Antony, take Caesar’s body.
That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him.
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam?
Is that you, wife?
Here comes my wife now.
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood.
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?
We’ll follow you.
Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you?
What features?
Yes, my lord.
I won’t betray them.
Come here, herald.—Let the trumpet sound!—Read this out.
And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.
It’s women crying, my good lord.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Our poor father, Clarence!
For more important things, you’ll say no.
Goodbye.
Does she?
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.
It’s time to put our armor on.
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
Petruchio?
Do you love me?
Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.
There was no story, my lord.
If I were king?
It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.
There were many even more memorable feasts.
I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.
What is my nation?
I see.
The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions will result.
I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.
I may command the one I love.” Well, she commands me.
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two?
Oh, how stupid!
I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.
On a night like this!
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.
The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.
You’re not leaving the house today.
Ah, my good old friends!
Listen to me patiently.
No, not me, sir.
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.
In private?
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
Tell me why, if you can.
And yet I’ll still have plenty.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
Here comes Lorenzo.
Good night.
Not to his father’s house.
You don’t know how to pick a man.
What did my man say?
Stay in your cabins.
Come on.
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches.
You worthless man!
I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it.
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow!
Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted.
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of.
If not, goodbye.
No, good Sir Toby.
If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world.
Believe me, King of Illusions, I made a mistake.
Has she already forgotten her brave husband, Prince Edward, whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger?
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were 
Really, are you afraid of that?
Where do you come from, sir?
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay.
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy.
No.
Are you behind some bush?
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.
Give me your torch, boy.
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
Regan gives good advice.
Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.
Well, thank you.
That means it’s high time for me to go.
Not until we part as friends.
So is Lysander.
You do their work for them and give them good luck.
Don’t give up yet.
Yes.
He’s laughing already!
Get out of my sight!
Good.
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.
What were you before this?
A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways.
Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him. 
Let’s move again, my friends.
Take me.
You would take it back?
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
It was just an accident!
Master, do you really mean that?
She’s the devil.
You’re a villain to say this about me.
You absolute villain!
You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?
I never caused her any harm, as far as I know.
Don’t worry about me not swearing enough.
That’s what I thought too, sir.
I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies.
Did they make you the messenger?
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection.
Oh, you stupid Moor!
Oh, to hell with those people!
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
He’s still sleeping, ma'am.
Get busy, go!
Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
Don’t hurt me, please.
Now I have to leave.
Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles.
But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola.
I say that I love you more than he does.
Oh, I really think she loves me!
That’s great.
No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!
How did he try to persuade you to love him?
Sing my praises to your mistress.
Now, I swear by Apollo… By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain.
No, no, put your hat back on.
It is, my lord.
No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.
Amen to that.
St. George loses his holiness once  Then, by myself— You’ve misused yourself.
Should we watch this ridiculous scene?
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
But for the whole world?
Take that, and that.
Why, so did you.
I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters.
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.
My lord, what are you talking about?
If that were true, then I’d know your secret.
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs.
I’m sure everything will be fine.
The king is coming here tonight.
How strange that they all got so sleepy!
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
I’d send seven of my servants to go get him.
I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything.
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.
This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered.
No, nothing.
Nurse!
Good noble ladies, be brave.
Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?
You’re right, actually.
Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold?
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
What’s the matter?
Your words are idiotic.
Doesn’t that sound like true love?
Don’t you 
He couldn’t eat without me talking about it.
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now?
If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France.
What news do you have?
Show him and make him grieve.
What do you think of his belief?
And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men?
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.
What’s going on here?
Oh, yes I am, father.
It was a color he never did like.
Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.
Really, cousin, it’s him.
What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!
No?
She’s sending this ring back to you, sir.
He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him.
I hope your Majesty will, in all good conscience, bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me.
Boys, how are you both doing?
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta.
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor!
I’m sure of that.
Come on, sir.
Doesn’t he deserve it?
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
We don’t think so, my lord.
There isn’t much time.
I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned.
Ask it something, Horatio.
I’d like to think all men have some hope.
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
No, he hasn’t.
Where should we go?
Will she go to bed now?
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.
Now, you lie there on the path.
God, that song’s even better than the other one.
You can decide that privately.
Come on, come on.
And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale, you wouldn’t believe.
Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake.
By the god Jupiter above, I swear “No.” By Jupiter’s wife Juno, I swear “Yes.” They wouldn’t dare.
Who else should it be?
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples.
Yes, if you want to help yourself.
I don’t doubt your wisdom.
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
Yes, that one.
A good plan, warrior king.
You’re leaving with my tongue in your tail?
Well, well.
Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding.
Aren’t you dead yet?
The rest of the dead are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen of birth and rank.
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
I’ll go back to sleep now.
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.
Be happy about it.
First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown—if it were truly my birthright—I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it.
Judge for yourself.
Let him run far away.
On that point, our letters don’t agree.
She’s as dead as the cold ground.
I’ll go call the watch.
Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever.
And when will you see him again?
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Come forward and speak.
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are!
Oh luck, luck.
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak.
What’s that noise?
Why?
In every good thing they do.
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
Come on, my dear Greek philosopher.
I swear— By nothing, because this is no oath.
What a man!—especially compared to my husband.
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him, as it does this good king’s blood.
Come on—kill me and brag about it!
She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?
Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.
The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it.
I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin.
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.
Yes.
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver.
I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice.
Man, they were asking for it.
Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze.
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.
You seem a little depressed about this.
I’ll show you how.
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
Come break this up, Benvolio.
The sun will not appear today.
Do you think I’d break my oath?
He smiled and said, “The better for us.” He’s right, and that’s how it is.
Madam, I am not well.
So if we know that a man is a thief, should we try to arrest him?
God bless you for doing this.
I don’t wish that on you.
What time is it?
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat.
Shame on you!
That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.
It’s gone.
Oh, dear!
Portia, are you really gone?
After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—
Master Malvolio?
Do you know me?
You’re not going to take him.
What my lord said I was.
If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can.
Richmond is sailing on the sea.
Yes, if you kept them together and invested them.
Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?
If I don’t love her, I’m completely 
A little bit.
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite.
Then my love is humble.
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
Good sir—
Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want.
We will, my lord.
You have amazed me.
I wish I knew what was in your heart.
Or rather, do what you feel like doing.
Good-bye, great commander.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain.
Seek!
But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride.
Oh, my dear mistress, I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest.
I only want idiots following my advice, the advice of a fool.
They certainly will.
Along the way, I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives, as step one in the plan we’ve discussed.
So much for our plan.
I love you dearly, Ariel.
Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are  Me, too.
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold, he’s a lively lad, a wag, born of fine parents, good with his fists.
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well.
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
That’s for to me to decide.
Draw the curtains, just like that.
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
The court awards it and the law authorizes it.
Sir Thomas Erpingham.
He just said that they’re no good at acting.
His counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor, and then he’ll take over.
But why, why, why?
Please, sir, restrain yourself.
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts.
No trouble, sir.
Remember you!
You lie, you disgusting tyrant.
What man were you talking to at your window last night, between the hours of midnight and one?
Show them in.
What’s the news!
We’ll drive them to a 
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
Girls, girls!
We found him in the churchyard.
Indeed I did, my lord.
Murder and treason!
To escape the decree condemning me
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
She’s crying.
What did he do to you?
That’s uncivilized and unnatural!
We have to get out of here, old man.
Besides, they’re fresh.
Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve.
I, sir, am Dromio.
I will see them.
Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now.
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
Then he’s no good.
Trinculo, speak politely.
Goodness, it’s daylight.
It’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
That whore?
I like her more than I can say.
Oh that great, funny guy, Bottom!
His daughter and I will be king and queen—God protect us!—and you and Trinculo will be our governors.—Do you like that idea, Trinculo?
How many, can you guess?
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed.
I’ll get there.
Why are you adored?
Is that the naked guy?
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
Be happy.
So, goodbye.
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order.
Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
Are you wise?
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now?
Greetings, good general!
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
Where is Montjoy, the herald?
But what about your guilty conscience?
Draw your sword, you jerk!
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
He started it, my noble lord, and succeeding generations rebuilt it.
Evil villain!
I could be sad if I wanted to be.
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.
No, you must see them as your father sees them.
They all fell asleep together, as if they’d planned it.
Damn you!
His name’s Cinna.
Twenty crowns.
How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?
Very pleased to meet you, my lord.
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy.
Uncle, please give me your dagger.
What do you say, my fair  I do not know dat.
Follow her.
Goodbye, Goodbye!
Then we won’t agree to his demands.
The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool.
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point.
I promise I’ll carry the wood faster.
Every one of us is a criminal.
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you, as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse.
Someone who was always near you.
And they’ve got their swords unsheathed!
That will never happen.
I’ll put it on anyway.
Hello, sir.
No, I swear I’m not.
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Listen to my little story, and when it’s done, oh, my heart will break!
Why are you whipping that whore?
Anger does not protect the angry well.
All the rest of you can leave too.
What is this fuzzy logic?
All hail, Macbeth!
What?
In God’s name, who are you?
Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head.
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news.
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides.
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests.
Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.
He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.
Please call him and tell him to come back here.
But their trick failed.
Who do you think?
You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.
I took the hint and spoke to her.
I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced.
All right, then.
Damn you for mocking me.
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.
But tell me, how is your cousin?
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume.
He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now.
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs?
Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby.
Call me when it’s lit.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run in the streets as though it were doomsday.
Ask him to go in.
I know that, sir.
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food!
Caesar!
Get on your way and hire those horses.
Den it shall also content me.
That big ship over there looks no bigger
Well, death is the end for everybody.
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.
Madam, you’ve treated me badly, very badly.
Go on, Caesar.
Please come in.
Very well, ma'am.
Exactly right.
I know that he’ll be on our side.
No, a whole share for me.
Sin from my lips?
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
Well, did you think about what I said?
Not me.
Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again.
Where is he?
Come on, boy.  
Is it that aggressive?
It was I, in fact, whom you promised to strike.
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion.
Why did you send me out, brave Cassius?
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today.
And like I am for Rosalind.
What time is it?
A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.
You may hear about it soon.
I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil.” You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark.” You have overshot.
You don’t really love me.
I’ll wear this one and none other.
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
Cure her of that.
I’m already here, sir.
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus.
If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
We human beings don’t control our own destinies.
Who comes with him?
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon.
This makes me feel so much better!
Let me have it now.
Quiet!
Oh, I wish I had my rosary!
He won’t see my face ever again.
My husband!
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened.
I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it.
I always pray for them 
Lord, how painful it was to drown.
What on earth does that mean?
I’ll make ground beef out of you.
Don’t tempt me to suicide again.
Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are.
And Trinculo’s drunk.
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.
Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us!
Arm myself?
Thank you, sir.
Damned Iago!
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun.
The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.” You’d take anything for a mistress.
I know exactly how to proceed.
Be quiet, for shame!
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums?
So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.
I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.
Indeed, his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly, it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick.
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.
What are you, girl?
Alright, let’s fight, boy!
I will say as much to his face.
We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil.
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity.
That means it’s more likely to be fake.
I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again.
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman?
That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night.
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her.
Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.
him terribly.
Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about.
Master, master, I’ve been on the lookout so long, I’m ready to fall down dead—but I’ve got one, finally!
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done.
He hasn’t arrived yet.
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel.
A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have.
I don’t care if you love me or not, I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any.
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial, as I have more reason to mourn than you do.
Foolish dogs, blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
Really?
And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.
So you couldn’t see his face, then?
What does the golden box say?
Well, all right then.
And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too.
As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.
What if she won’t kiss me?
Even if he were as important a man as the devil—as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself—he’s required, see, your Grace, to keep his vow.
They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.
I see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company.
You won it.
Yes, well, things could get better.
Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.
Goodbye.
No one here is affected by your curse, because curses are just words with no power.
Can we go?
They are, my lord.
With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.
My lord loves you.
How am I unfaithful?
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge.
Oh, she’s slow!
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.
My creditors are getting mean.
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
I love you all the more for not liking it.
He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth.
I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness.
I’ll scalp you.
But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes.
My mask is like the roof of the poor 
That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
I swear, I scorn the word.
She’s too much for me to handle.
Here comes your father.
Listen, please, give me the necklace.
The English have promised me thousands of troops.
I have more news too.
What was the second noise for?
And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me, still my blood begins to flatter me that you do, despite the ill effects of my face.
Before I saw Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me.
You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!
It’s true.
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
Yes, my lord.
What is it?
I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated.
But goodbye.
The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream.
He’s married.
I honor him for being brave.
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away.
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
If you want to make me happy, don’t wish yourself harm.
Have you had lunch yet?
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
I’m game.
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
Let’s not get gloomy in our reminiscing, since there’s no reason for sadness anymore.
Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.
My noble king, my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother, the haughty Bishop of Exeter, are now in  My king, the Guildfords in  My lord, the duke of Buckingham’s army— Enough, you 
I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian.
Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s?
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
Oh, heaven, how did she get out?
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive.
My lord, I have news for you.
But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
Give him room.
to wage war.
When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.
Call up your courage.
Aren’t the others waiting for me, Cinna?
Let me see them.
There were no primary ones.
No doubt, for you wear too many in the first place, and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer.
You probably killed a lot of his men?
Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
What a horrible day!
I’ll be crippled forever!
Out here everybody can see us.
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
Thank you.
Yes, noble lord.
In his greatest need, even they will desert him.
Be there, or don’t show your face again.
Are you thinking of buying her?
But his punishment was bitter death.
From now on, goodness in women, not superficial beauty, will win my heart.
Think about it.
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding.
How will that kill this marriage?
The point is that she didn’t write this letter.
My clerk has some comforting news for you, too.
But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter.
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Well, onward, then.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
I’m ready now.
Hurry.
He really was tricked horribly.
I will lower my voice.
Now you’re sociable.
I really think it was him.
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.
There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman.
How is your majesty doing?
You don’t think you can teach her?
Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
I’ll just stay here till the storm passes.
What’s his name?
Here, 
That’s right.
No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought.
I haven’t done anything to you.
But as of right this second all these things are yours.
Come here, ma'am.
his daughter, Katherine, with some insignificant, unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry.
I took your hands in friendship, but, indeed, I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar.
If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.
No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year.
Sir Toby needs help right away.
They’re speaking to him.
I hope to God he keeps his promise!
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel, and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
How literal this guy is!
I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice.
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
You look angry.
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s.
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me.
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
Dear gods, bless this couple, since you’re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here.
They’re very anxious for you to get there.
If not, then this parting was well done.
Why, this was modeled on a porridge bowl!
Remove your armor, Eros.
He had his helmet visor up.
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the winner.
Stand up.
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.
Cruel, cruel news!  
I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
We’ll come with you, your Grace.
You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages.
Oh, is that Kent?
Good day to you, sir.
Do you have the lion’s part written down?
Show us the way without further delay.—Trinculo, since the king and all our comrades are drowned, we’re the heirs of this place.—Here, carry my wine bottle.—Trinculo, my buddy, we’ll get that bottle refilled soon enough.
Toward Chertsey, noble lord?
I’ve made a risky investment.
Good—here’s the stretcher.
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
No, girl!
Brutus killed me.
You told me to do the same, my liege.
Do you really think so?
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you.
Hands, speak for me!
Yours, Claudio, yours, I say.
Quickly, tell me how.
Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches.
You take the bill and I’ll take your yardstick.
Get off the field, my lord.
Then if he dies, his death serves him.
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.
I will not be faced or bested.
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.
I recognize something about that voice.
If you’re just insane, then get out of here.
Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this?
She’s not even fourteen years old.
Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say.
I might do something I’ll be sorry for.
This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me.
Why, you scoundrel!
I think that’s strange.
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall.
Yes, just like this.
The gods protect him from so great a shame!
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
No, this fun is not for me.
No one else would.
Hail, brave friend!
That’s why there must be space between you. 
I can’t let my lips say his name; “No man must know.”
You, who are neither honest nor good.
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.
Sir, I can’t.
I’m not in a joking mood.
This speech is going on too long.
I will, my lord.
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.
I look forward to that present.
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well, and now I need your help again.
So let me sleep next to you.
That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
No, not for all the world.
Have you forgotten who I am?
Answer me in a word.
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.
Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart.
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.
That’s true.
Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
Well, I won’t.
Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel.
What do you call this?
Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now.
I lent my body once to make him rich.
So cheer up.
Please, my king, be quiet.
Damn that Toby!
I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time.
Let’s do that, Lysander.
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.
Choose your revenge.
No I don’t, believe me.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
Why do you keep repeating that, woman?
Teach me how I should think and speak.
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
I think it’s important.
That’s all there is to it.
But I’ll go in.
At this time of night?
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
You lover of that damned whore, you’re talking to me of “ifs”?
What, are you sleepy?
Should we see what he thinks?
Alas, why would you heap all these responsibilities on me?
But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!— Come on, get to the point.
Hit them!
What has the governor of the town decided?
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
I cannot speak your England.
He talks nothing but nonsense.
God, not our strength, be praised!
Come.
What are you talking about, man?
So, there’s the signal to ride.
The morning is approaching.
Can you do that?
Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile.
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death.
Hey!
It’s noble Kent, your friend.
Poor Harry of England!
Our fate depends on this chance.
In a way, I mean.
Do my simple features please you?
Those are her orders.
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again, and I’ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble.
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?
He answered, “You penniless bastard!
Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.
Madam, I’d better leave now.
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.
What’s the problem, that they cry out so loud?
We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I’m the older and more terrible.
So tell me what’s been going on.
Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks.
Come, put it over my face. 
Who’s calling me?
Oh my Christian ducats!
Do what he says, William.
Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy spot?
I don’t know you.
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.
We’re still waiting for one more.
Who asked you to call her?
Where are you now?
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose.
Let me wipe it off first.
Pay attention.
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit.
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
And now it looks like you need my help.
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.
I hope those lions stay far away from him.
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.
How old is he?
Neighbors and friends, though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table, you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself.
Now please, tell Beatrice to come out.
But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires.
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.
Give me my sword.
Of course we will.
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me.
But you have all the advantages from the harm done.
Antony will go where his passion is.
Father, go ahead.
When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this.
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king?
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?
He has almost finished dinner.
Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead.
So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness.
If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better.
You disgust me, you little bug!
I want to be this Duke’s servant.
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing.
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped.
There it is.
Confess and love” is more like it.
Lady, come out of the tomb.
And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.
Very much so.
They won’t pinch me, frighten me, push me in the mud, or mislead me unless he tells them to.
God be good to you!
I’m at your service.
I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too.
What do you want to do, Desdemona?
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?
We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else.
And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
In saving you I consider myself well paid.
Who are you, slave?
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
Is there anything offensive in it?
I hope you’re not drowned.
Tell me, how did you get in here?
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.
Yes, we are.
What do you mean, the seventh cause?
Are you headed to the Tower?
That’s all.
Come along, though.
Come on, can I get you two to make up?
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!
As you please.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
Are they all ready?
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.
Othello’s career is over.
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees.
Look at this man.
Make your confession short.
Oh, please don’t swear, my lord of Buckingham.
He did this in public?
I’m an ass, I’m a woman’s servant, and I’m beside myself.
Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance.
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
What villain, madam?
And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow.
Did I do anything good to myself?
Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.
He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.
There’s no ambiguity here.
How did you divide yourself in two?
Are you talking about Caesar?
What have you done?
How strange I’m feeling!
What, an argument already?
Will you be patient?
And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good.
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
Therefore, great king, we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy.
Can’t I say something?
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate.
How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher!
Oh, you villain!
Murder!
Will you help me?—What an ass and a fool, a gullible no-good idiot!
I’m sure he will stay under control.
He’s afraid to come in.
So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.
Yes, my lord.
We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart.
What’s wrong with you?
Where’s Antony?
Would you mind if we woke up the king?
Well, sir, the gown is not for me.
Don’t be sad that this happened because of you, because Lady Luck’s been nicer to me than usual.
I pick the younger one.
Everyone join hands.
That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous.
Heaven knows.
And now I’m going to leave your despised company.
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened.
I’ll be gentle and mild.
I didn’t think I would see you here.
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.
Get out of here, you measly, lying wretch.
No, boy.
I know you.
Hurry, hurry—prepare my horse.
How are you feeling, Malvolio?
What does Romeo say?
Are you an actor?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
That’s our offer.
Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king.
So goodbye until we meet again.
As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married. 
But what do you say to my request?
Promising favors?
Are you going to provoke me?
In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake.
To Adriana?
I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave.
I’m involved in your rivalry.
Come here, you wretch!
Here was a Caesar!
He still hasn’t told us about the captain.
I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf.
Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears.
I want to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my legs.
Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers.
You mean a devil!
Someone who can ride fast, go to the duke of  Here, my good lord.
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action?
I’ll make her come right away, I promise you.
Terrible.
It sets you up for a fall.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter.
All right, I’ll stop.
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
Oh, excellent!
And you’re my husband, right?
All right.
Don’t leave me in the lurch.
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!
But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia.
Doors, open up for whoever is knocking!
It’s a good tragedy, very well done.
Who am I then?
Do you have any doubts, Antonio?
It 
Babbling senselessly?
Damn it, shut your mouth.
I have it ready.
Please, corporal, stop!
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.
Am I not wise?
Are you starting to challenge me?
By Jove that thunders!
Get out of here quickly!
Here.
Your beautiful eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine with love.
Take comfort.
