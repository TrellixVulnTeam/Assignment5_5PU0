Keep peace, upon your lives.
I hope better.
How doth the prince?
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
But yet—   Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping, unrestored.
Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona.
Never excuse—for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed.

Take up my mistress' gown for thy master’s use!
Go to, you are too shrewd.

I would I were at home.
I protest I love thee.
Dromio, nor thou?
What claim lays she to thee?
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.
Bring thou the master to the citadel.
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent?
Why, what’s the matter?
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.

I shall offend, either to detain or give it.
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.

We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, And he shall say you are not well today.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Caesar, I go.

He misses not much.
Even now, sir.
You are too indulgent.
Hail to your lordship.

Bad is the world, and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.
Say what, is Horatio there?
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.
But what though?
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
A good knave.

Welcome.

But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
Here, sirrah Grumio.
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?

Welcome home, Grumio.
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?

This is the fruits of whoring.
Be not afeard.
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have.
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munched, and munched, and munched.
Soft!
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.
You make me study of that.
Tis pity of him.
Lucentio, gentle sir.
I never shall endure her.
Take them in. 
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Brutus, a word with you.
A little water clears us of this deed.

I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her.
With whom?
Meantime God grants that we have need of you.
Out, alas!
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
I go; and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
Look, here comes the duke.
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains.

It waves me still.
I mean not cuckold mad, But sure he is stark mad.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.
Ha, banishment!
My sweet Cassio!
What raiment will your Honor wear today?
But how long shall that title “ever” last?
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
And did not she herself revile me there?
Why, to put ’s head in—not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case.
Wilt come?
He lies to th' heart.
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
Oh, dispatch me!
Come not in here, nuncle.
Receive what cheer you may.
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband.
To this chair bind him.—Villain, thou shalt find— By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard.
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
Now, soldiers, march away, And how Thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.

I’ll not fail, if I live.
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!

We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.
This a dull sight.
Did he take interest?
My liege.
I am bound to your niece, sir.
Is it not past two o'clock?
It ripens towards it.
Return with her?
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?
Then weep no more.
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious!
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
Ay, marry, must you.
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin!
What are you?
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
Oh, heaven have mercy on me!
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand.
To answer that, I should confess to you.
Villainous whore!
A credulous father, and a brother noble— Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy.
And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.

Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Then there is the County Palatine.
Be quiet, people.
So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!
Farewell content!
So, so, so.
Uncle!
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
I was contracted to them both.
Ay, too gentle.
Content.
What are you?
Farewell.
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
Who offered him the crown?
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.
I have a pain upon my forehead, here.
Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.
Come, seek the conspirators.
Decius, well urged.
Knock at the gate?
Never, Iago.
Bring them before us.
What, my lord?
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.
Did he receive you well?
Music, ho!
Thou canst not choose but know who I am.
Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”   Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
Oh, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
Now, good sir, what are you?
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication.
I loved him, friend— No father his son dearer.
Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just.
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Ay, sir, for three months.
Tear him, tear him!
Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew.
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Oh, my dear Cassio!
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
Utter my thoughts?
Come, sir.
Stands he or sits he?
My master’s mind.
The house will be the quieter.
Hark!
He did command me to call timely on him.
Peace, peace, Iras.
I’ll be at thy elbow.
Then forth, dear countrymen.
God grant him health.
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
Fathers that wear rags  Do make their children blind.
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.— Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
Macbeth!
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on.
What would my lord?
Now to you.
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.
That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t.
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
And what to?
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
Or shall I say her uncle?
There I have another bad match!—a bankrupt, a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart.
Is that the meaning of “accost”?
O, one too much by thee!
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone.
Madam, with all my heart.
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge.
That dreamers often lie.
The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks, That their designment halts.
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour Of love, of worldly matter and direction, To spend with thee.
It is not so expressed, but what of that?
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Marry, now I can tell.
Marry, well remembered.
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.
O woeful day!
Most constantly.
Think you so?
Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime.
I’ll tarry no longer with you.
He himself Calls her a nonpareil.
Let’s speak to him.
Nay, go not back.
The time has been That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end.
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.
Well, go to, I will.
What is your will that I shall do with this?
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.
Press near and second him.
Excellent.
Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.
And will you give me leave?
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth.
Give me thy arm.
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part— I mean your voice for crowning of the king.
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
This was his basket.
Where lies he?
That’s my office.
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
Even since you left it.
Deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you!
Receive it so.
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.
What enterprise, Popillius?
No, sir, no jot.
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound?
Oh, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast.
Tis well blown, lads.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
The date is out of such prolixity.
Bear with my weakness.
I must needs report the truth.
Well, as time shall try.
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
The poop was beaten gold, Purple the sails, and so perfumèd that The winds were lovesick with them.
You must be father to your brother’s daughter, And give her to young Claudio.
Oh, coward that I am, to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
Pray ye, go.
But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty.
Pluck up, my heart, and be sad.
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth. 
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her.
But soft, but soft a while.
I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field.
I can see a church by daylight.
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,  And follows but for form,  Will pack when it begins to rain  And leave thee in the storm.
Turn melancholy forth to funerals.
Ay, boy.
Who shall begin?
I think the world’s asleep.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Farewell, thou lob of spirits.
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
She give it Cassio?
Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts, whilst I run on it.
Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
Tis certain.
Now she holds me not.
He’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free.
But, Othello, speak.
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
What is thy name?
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
Be merciful, say “death,” For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Why, at her father’s.
Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think?
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham, And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
This the Dauphin speaks.
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich.
Didst hear her speak?
Fare thee well at once.
But chiefly Him that you termed, sir, “the good old Lord Gonzalo,” His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds.
Never talk to me.
Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Tis certain then for Cyprus.
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
Fare you well.
This is a sleepy tune.
Upon the king!
Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way.
Tis strange.
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?
Ay, my lord.
I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these.
Oh that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!
He does hear me, And that he does I weep.
O, belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower.
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
He sees thee not.
Ay, good fool.
For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace.
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
You will never run mad, niece.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead.
Now, where’s your master?
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle, Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learnèd bishops.
And stay, good Nurse.
Because their business still lies out o' door.
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.
I’ll go another way to work with him.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.
Well, fare you well, my lord.
Let us bear him  To th’ court of guard.
Peace, peace!
No, thou proud dream, That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.
I do love it better than laughing.
Of it own color too.
I think thou art in mind, and so am I. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
Tis cowardly and womanish.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.
Why, Rosalind!
May I know?
No, sir.
Not one to throw at a dog.
Doth not  Ay, Nurse, what of that?
I shall obey, my lord.
So perhaps did yours.
A laughter.
Lie—   With her?
No, by no means.
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house.
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes.
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
There’s knocking at the gate.
That’s all.
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
You are welcome for his sake.
I am weary of you. 
Five-and-twenty, sir.
Bring me to Octavius.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face— With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.
A very weak monster.
Speak once again.
By your patience, no.
If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.
Fare thee well awhile.
He hath every month a new sworn brother.
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
Wherefore?
You hear how he importunes me.
With all my heart.
No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die.
Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords.
A sibyl, that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sewed the work.
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.
I am famished in his service.
It is the prince of palfreys.
When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy.
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds.
For two, and sound ones too.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.
Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.
Knock, sir?
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Beat me?
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness' love.
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.
Enough.
Therefore go with me.
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.
Would it not make one weep?
Away!
My brave spirit!
Who ambles time withal?
The time of universal peace is near.
Leave holloaing, man.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.
Is that the law?
Not stingless too?
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances.
Some wine, ho!              
Nothing will come of nothing.
What, did Caesar swoon?
Her name, that was as fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face.
Find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head.
You may think I love you not.
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs.
He dies that strikes again.
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak, And speak I will.
Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince.
What villain touched his body, that did stab, And not for justice?
I cannot tell.
I have brought you from Venice.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?
The king’s a-bed.
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
God keep your Worship!
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
Where, where?
Very well.
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.
Be patient till the last.
So shalt thou show me friendship.
Do you know what you say?
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
O Cassio, whence came this?
Despair and die!
I am feared in field and town.
To who, my lord?—Who hath the office?
Will you go? 
Read the will!
I will go seek the king.
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
But I am much to blame.
I think not so, my lord.
She is herself a dowry.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings.
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
Come, come, away.
Ay, my lord, this same.
Lives he?
Up, princes, and, with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords, hie to the field: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; You dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, and of Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jacques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Faulconbridge, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois; High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and knights, For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate.
And they are gone.
Are you native of this place?
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Let it be so.
Hear Antony.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Some are born great—”
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
How now, my metal of India?
He cannot like her long.
Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
I say amen to her.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time.
Not so, not so.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation.
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.
Thou canst not.
And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself.
O these deliberate fools!
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan.
Post to Salisbury.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
Will it never be day?
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow, Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
I am glad of your departure.
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.
I will walk by.
It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown.
They cannot budge till your release.
And you.
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
And she goes down at twelve.
Nay, take my life and all.
Take him up gently, and to bed with him, And each one to his office when he wakes.
Can virtue hide itself?
What will you give us?
Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
If you dare fight today, come to the field.
No boasting like a fool.
Lie not a night from home.
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
I pray you, is my master yet returned?
Know’st thou the way to Dover?
I will hear further reason for this.
With Demetrius.
So I am free.
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
How if they will not?
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age.
He’s coming, madam.
I warrant her rags and the 
A bitter fool.
Shall I strike now?

Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.
Good night, honest Iago.
The minute of their plot Is almost come.—Well done.

How now, Oswald?
Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
Sir, most heedfully.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
Away, away, for he is coming hither!
My door is lock’d.
That’s the end.
My necessaries are embarked.

God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself.
Shall they see us?
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze.
And thou, all-shaking thunder, Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man!

Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive.
What may she not?

What’s the matter, lieutenant?
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.

What is this castle called that stands hard by?
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries.

I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books— “Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,” As a sick girl.
Grumio, my horse.
Well, let’s away and say how much is done.

Make we our march towards Birnam.

Give you good night.
Young boys and girls Are level now with men.

O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely, gentlemanlike man.

Very good, my lord.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
Hoo!
Madman and beggar too.
O hell, what have we here?
What, household stuff?
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no laboring i' th' winter.

Ha!
God will revenge it.
Adieu, noble Agrippa.
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
I crave the law, The penalty, and forfeit of my bond.
Very gladly.
Quoth my master.
And he’s gone.
Thou dost not mark me.
We are resolved, my lord.
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored.
I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
What man is that?
My lord, your promise for the earldom— Richmond!
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
No.
What is yond gentleman?
Good night to you.
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes—and moreover, I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.
Farewell.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determinèd to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
I should have given ’t you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.
I hear their drum.
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me, spurn me—nay, to kill me too.
Whither?
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?
Yes, faith.
God keep you from them, and from such false friends.
We’ll hear a play tomorrow.
Hail, mortal.
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
I have heard her swear ’t.
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Caesar’s triumph.
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
My most dear lord!
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead.
O heavenly mingle!
Twas he informed against him, And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course.
Happily he’s the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
Then you do not love me?
And so adieu, sir.
Here’s to Caesar.
I am none of his flirt-gills.
I pray you stand good father to me now.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
I would the fool were married to her grave!
So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
Content with Hermia?
No, truly.
Tis twenty year till then.
If die, be brief, That our swift-wingèd souls may catch the king’s, Or, like obedient subjects, follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
I promise you, my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
I must obey.
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis; And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves When no man was his own.

Trouble yourselves no further.

All blessed secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears.
Well, what was yours?
She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Why, this would make a man a man of salt, To use his eyes for garden water-pots, Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.
Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.
What company is this?
Will you hear the letter?
Even he, sir.
Free, madam, no.
What hath he said?
I have brought him a present.
We must not.
Is she not a modest young lady?
What a sigh is there!
There’s one at the gate.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.
No.
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character.
A most poor credulous monster.—Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
Sweet-heart!
Come to me, that of this I may speak more.
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
Is ’t not enough, is ’t not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency?
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defense, To say I have done no harm?
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel.
Say, how grows it due?
It is an honor that I dream not of.
May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment!
Thus losers part.
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
This business is well ended.
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you?
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
Your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.
Therefore I promise ye I fear you.
Do so, good Messala.
But soft you, let me be.
Her name is Margery, indeed.
And here will rest me.
Good sir, be a man, Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you.
Look where they come.
Over hill, over dale,  Thorough bush, thorough brier,  Over park, over pale,  Thorough flood, thorough fire.
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
You think I’ll weep?
Well, but what’s o'clock?
Where goes Cesario?
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion— Have you a daughter?
I shall do ’t. 
What’s he That was not born of woman?
Nay, then, thou mock’st me.
I should venture purgatory for ’t.
Ah me!
Pray you, hasten Your generals after.
Yours, if you talk of tales.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.
Now let me see if I can conster it.
Alas, sir, be patient.
Worthy prince, I know ’t.
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.
These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.
The players cannot keep counsel.
I am not here.
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.

I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it.
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
Dispatch.
I saw him yesterday”—or “t' other day,” Or then, or then, with such or such—“and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o'ertook in’s rouse, There falling out at tennis,” or, perchance, “I saw him enter such a house of sale”—   Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.
My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame.
I’ll tell thee more of this another time.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.
What makes him here?
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us?
With duty and desire we follow you.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
What?
I cross me for a sinner.
God be wi' you and keep you and heal your pate.
Stand, an you be a man.
The door is open, sir.
Hum!
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.
Some must go off.
Hie, make haste, Make haste.
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
A brave vessel Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces.
Run, run, O, run!
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
Romeo’s a dishclout to him.
For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living.
I’ll follow it.
Have you that I sent you for?
The storm is up and all is on the hazard.
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.
Witness you That he is borne about invisible.
Decius Brutus loves thee not.
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.
Still in this fashion, color, ornament, For him I imitate.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent.
What’s the matter with thee now?
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here.
I’ll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word of war, we have effected: How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field.
This is practice, Gloucester.
My lord it shall be done.
Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.
By running fast.
They must lie there.
Am not I your Rosalind? 
Then belike my children shall have no names.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.
What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
I and my bosom must debate awhile, And then I would no other company.
Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in great danger.
God give your Grace good rest.
I must love you and sue to know you better.
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior.
Lo, where he comes!
Good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed.
Give me leave, Caesar.
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.
More, I prithee, more.
He shall stay my leisure.
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
One kiss, and I’ll descend.
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love.
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly.
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
Then show it me.
The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter change Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world, By their increase, now knows not which is which.
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster.
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is, Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipped and tormented and—Good e'en, good fellow.
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.—   Ay, so he says.
A great suspicion.
Please, let me stay.
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?
Speak, Agrippa.
The poison of that lies in you to temper.
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Informed them”?
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says “God give you good rest.”  Well, sir, there rest in your foolery.
Show me the place.
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.
Coldhearted toward me?
Tis he.
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.— Concerning this, sir—Oh, well-painted passion!— I am commanded home.—Get you away, I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!
He’s speaking now, Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?” For so he calls me.
Oh, let us hence.
Oh, did he so?
Fie!
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wandered forth, in care to seek me out.
I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.
I have sent for these strawberries.
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you—      Pray you, content.
Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places.
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.
This I made good to you In our last conference, passed in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say, “Thus did Banquo.”      You made it known to us.
Well, think of marriage now.
Hold, sir, for God’s sake!
My love thou art, my love, I think.
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me.
Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy’s day.
Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius?
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
I never saw a better-fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.
There’s fire ready.
Shall I attend your Grace?
Right well, dear madam.
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us.
What men may do!
Nay, but swear ’t.
Is it good e'en?
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?— Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
Madam, in Rome.
List, list, O, list!
Where is he?
Sojourn in Mantua.
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood, With that sour ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
Pray thee, marry us.
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!
I love thee not.
Why, there, there, there, there!
Wherefore?
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument.
I have years on my back forty- eight.
What are you?
Many times, madam.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth—and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four—she is not fourteen.
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
Our duty to your honor.
Soon may I hear and see him.
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead— Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
I will plague them all, Even to roaring.
I tell you ’tis not very well.
I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport, And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
I tell you, Captain, if you look in the maps of the 'orld, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. 
Made you no more offense but what you speak of?
Do so.
Believe not so.
Now she’s gone for ever.— Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.
By no means” what?
Go you, call hither my fool.
On Thursday, sir?
When, without stratagem, But in plain shock and even play of battle, Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th' other?
He is a gentleman of a good house, and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns.
In thy foul throat thou liest.
Ay, good my lord.
I have offended reputation, A most unnoble swerving.
Madam, I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not.
Somebody knocks.
Why, go to then.
But how, but how?
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.
Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.—Let him see our commission, and talk no more.
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
No.
What is it she does now?
Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye.
He will bear you easily and reins well.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
I have undone three tailors.
If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee.
Fare you well, boy.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers.
Get you therefore hence, Poor miserable wretches, to your death, The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure, and true repentance Of all your dear offences.—Bear them hence.
You say well.
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Knock, knock!
For what is he they follow?
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him.—Enobarbus!
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
Most like a gentleman.
If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
Bear with him, Brutus.
That I did for him.
Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on?
Thieves!
Her mother hath many times told me so.
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.
Welcome, Publius.
When?
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
Launcelot and I are out.
Yea, my good lord.
Feed and sleep.
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo.
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals.
My life upon her faith!—Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her.
My sword, I say!
I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.
Go to, go to.
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?

Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
Take thee that too.
To take ’t again perforce— Monster ingratitude!
Open your gates.
Why, ay.
God save you, sir!
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
Cassio, my lord?

If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.
I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp.
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.

Would that alone o' love he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
The king’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then, like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped, cried, “Hell is empty And all the devils are here.”      Why, that’s my spirit!
Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.

She shall not harm thee, Helena.

How now, my lord?
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
Prithee, do not turn me about.
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
And in assemblies too.
Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him—marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter?
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!
Our will is Antony be took alive.
Iago, who began ’t?
This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.

Where is she?
Ay, my lord.
He stays upon your will.
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters.
The drink, the drink!

And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom?
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Old Cassius still.
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Of what color?

It doth appear you are a worthy judge.
With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
I go, I go.
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.

Good madam, patience.
From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine.
The noble duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away!

Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
I will speak lower.
Give me thy hand.
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Why did he so?
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself, Prevented from a damnèd enterprise.
I never knew woman love man so.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
The day is broke.

Take no note of him.
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
I eat the air, promise-crammed.
Good night, good night.
I fly, Biondello.
First let us go to dinner.
Roderigo!
How is ’t with you?
Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue.
Where is Malvolio?
To bed, to bed.

Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats.
And I am your Rosalind.

How far into the morning is it, lords?
Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou base, common, and popular?

By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
And why, sir, must they so?
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.
Nothing.
You come not Like Caesar’s sister.
Well, be it so.
I loved Ophelia.
Give me.
Come, warble, come.
I will, my lord.
I would my father looked but with my eyes.
Ass, I doubt not.
I will walk up and down here and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.

Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Oh, is that all?
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
I thank you, gentle uncle.
That must we also.
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
Content thee, gentle coz.
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appall the devil.
O Dardanius!
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself?
The transgression is in the stealer.
Consent to pay thee that I never had?— Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at.
I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.
What, with worms and flies?
These time ambles withal.
I’ll see it done.
I’ll put ’t in proof.
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.
Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation.
Fathers commonly Do get their children.
Or shall we on without apology?
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them; and of such as have, I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented.
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.
I am sorry to find you thus.
I partly know the man.
I say you are not.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it— A man, a prince by him so benefited?
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
By Dromio?
Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee.
Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least.
Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.
Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot, Which well appearèd in his lineaments, Being nothing like the noble duke my father.
O perjured woman!
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for.

I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.
No, I will weep no more.
If they do see thee they will murder thee.
I did nothing.
Why look you strange on me?
Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity.
Commend me to Lord William.
You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine— And all for use of that which is mine own.
By providence divine.
Away!
No, unpin me here.
Here’s a madman will murder me.
How now?
Till which encounter It is my business too.
Why,
I should have known no less.
O horror, horror, horror!
Mark me.
The gods reward your kindness!
My masters, are you mad?
Consent to swear.
For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to.
Good night, good doctor.
Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed.
I fear me you’ll be in till then.
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?
Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.
And how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
I am glad thy father’s dead, Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain.
Why, this' a heavy chance ’twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

True, madam.
That’s sides and heart.
Are you not good?
That will I, should I die the hour after.
Whither?
How came you to this?
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say “element,” but the word is overworn. 
The more fool you for laying on my duty.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble.

I know when one is dead and when one lives.

To Dover.
Cheerly, good Adam. 
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest.

Dost thou hear?
Her husband, sirrah?
Ding, dong, bell.
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar.
I’ll none of it.
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”      I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.

Unless the master were the man.
Who comes here?
The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced.
Not a false gallop.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.

Know we this face or no?
I’ll leave you, lady.
Here.
In the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
For the love of God, a surgeon!
I will not come.
He says so, Tranio?
Hold off thy hand.
Wilt thou be gone?
Till then, lead thou first.
Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound.
But goes thy heart with this?
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
I take my leave of you.
Buzz, buzz.
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom.
Let her alone.
This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banished.
Thou hast killed my child.
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds.
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.

I think it doth.
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?
Be bold, and take thy stand.
Tis such another fitchew.
I will not till I please.
My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the duke, How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course.
There’s something else to do.
Worse and worse.
Good counsel, marry.
But he sleeps.
Let him go up into the public chair.
Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
Speak your office.
Oh, you are men of stones.
I think not of them.
It is very hot.
Here, madam.
Go, prepare for dinner.
He had one yesterday.
March gently on to meet him.
You are a spirit, I know.
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
By your leave, hostess.
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.
I say amen, Gonzalo.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Tut, I have the best armor of the world.
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it.
What are his words?
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.
No matter whither, so you come not here.
I warrant you, madam.
I had forgot—three months.
Fie, that you’ll say so!
Pray you, no more of this.
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
Neither good nor bad.
He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Save you, friend Cassio!

Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry you mercy, friend.
I have no long spoon.
And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
I pray thee, overname them.
Trust to ’t, bethink you.
Give him heedful note.
Welcome, ass.
It is a wise father that knows his own child.
How say you by this change?
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again.
But you’ll be secret?
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here.
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
You shall hear me.
Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so—” Am I made?
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
And thus she means, videlicet— Asleep, my love?

Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.—I attend, I attend.
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
And when I have my meed, I will away, For this will out, and then I must not stay.
With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two.— Sweet, adieu.
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
World, world, O world!
Tis well I am found by you.
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
Her father loved me, oft invited me, Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed.
Dead art thou!
Do then, but I’ll not hear.
Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night’s shade.
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. 
So Caesar may.
Truly, a peck of provender.
Iago?
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.
Prates too.—What say you, James Soundpost?
In Sicyon.
Though I die for it—as no less is threatened me—the king my old master must be relieved.
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked.
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
But come, my lord, let’s away.
And so, my lord, adieu.
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.
I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.

Safer than trust too far.
Courage.
The king hath heard them, to the which as yet There is no answer made.
For himself to mar,” quoth he?
Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord, Before I positively speak in this.
What noise is this?
But where’s my fool?
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation—  Of my nation?
I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil—to deliver you.
Was ’t you he rescued?
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
Doth he not mend?
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
And you, sir.
Seem they religious?
You must not deny me.
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling, From miserable slumber I awaked.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear’st to die?
Look!
I will give thee mine.
How now, my pretty knave?
Then tell me If this might be a brother.
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
Why seek’st thou me?
Made you my guardians, my depositaries, But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.
Is not that neighborly?
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
You are he, you are he.
Or did I dream it so?
I will dispatch it straight.
I am a spirit of no common rate.
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures.
O vassal!
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.
I choose her for myself.
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly.
Come on.
Hie you to the cell.
And so had mine.
An unauthorized kiss!
Dear lady— Give me leave, beseech you.
Thou hast railed on thyself.
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.
Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him.
March on, march on, since we are up in arms, If not to fight with foreign enemies, Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
Here’s our own hands against our hearts.
Is it not Hero?
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
Some officers take them away.
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.
If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.
Throw some of them at me.
My master stays in the street.
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition.
Calls my lord?
Men at some time are masters of their fates.
His eyes were green as leeks.
I am transformèd, master, am I not?
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
Mistress, that you know.
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
He is about the house.
Dead?
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
What’s the matter?
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Mistake no more.
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night.
But till that time Come not thou near me.
O ill-starred wench, Pale as thy smock!
If it had been painful, I would not have come.
Thou saidst—Oh, it comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infectious house, Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
Boy!
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
You received no gold?
It is well.
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?
Hear it apart.
Let him not leave out The color of her hair.
How now?
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
Now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign. 
No way but gentleness, gently, gently.
Come, sir, I will not let you go.
Why, the honest men.
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.                 
You do advance your cunning more and more.
Oh, be sick, great greatness, And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
O Romeo, Romeo!
But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
Should I not say, “Hath a dog money?
A messenger from the galleys.
Let it be written in eight and eight.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.
Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.

Now Margaret’s curse is fall'n upon our heads, When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I, For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.
Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
what mistress, slave, hast thou?
Counterfeit, I assure you.
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
I’ll be gone.
I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry.
No.
Not a jot, not a jot.
I must believe my master; else, I promise you, I should be arguing still upon that doubt.
By such despair I should accuse myself.
Oh, but I fear.
Tis some mischance, the cry is very direful.
So he laughed and let me go.
Therefore weep.
I shall do’t, my lord.
Master, master!
What beard were I best to play it in?
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Fare you well.
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows.
Peace!

Let it appear so.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
All hail, Macbeth!
It shall be so.
Am I Dromio?

One?

Here comes another of the tribe.
Did ’t not wake you?
Tis paltry to be Caesar.
Bless us!
Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?
Bid the players make haste.
But what talk I of this?
I forgive you the praise.
Talk not to me.
Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking!
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
I thank his Grace.
Speak.
Out, you baggage!
What, not a whore?
Strike not by land; keep whole.
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
Let’s ha' ’t, good Grumio.
For what good turn?
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health.
What is, my lord?

I do confess my fault, And do submit me to Your Highness' mercy.
God be with you.
Stay, stand apart.
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
To what effect?
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown.

I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you.
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
Give me faith, say I.
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Only I yield to die.
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
Where’s that mongrel?
I do.
No, as I am a Christian.
I warrant it is to knight you, Captain.
Sweet, so would I.
Not we.
My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.

So would not I.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.
His Honor and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence.

Amen, say we.
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it, for there is none to guard it but boys. 
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
Why, what is Tybalt?
No?
I pray you do.
When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now.
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
Both?
Cassius, be constant.
What’s the matter?
I would they were, that I might die at once, For now they kill me with a living death.
No, hath not?
Let us leave him.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
Come on, assay.
Now does my project gather to a head.

Stay, madam.
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!

Seest not?
Yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
Mean you to enjoy him then?
Peace, you dull fool.
I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady.
Is she not apt?
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?
A quarrel, but nothing wherefore.
Fly, fly, my lord.
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.
Moody?
You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
Who is ’t you mean?
What’s his offense?
I do not know you so good a man as myself.
The manner of their deaths?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.
But speak, Egeus.
Who, queasy with his insolence already, Will their good thoughts call from him. 
I will not stay to offend you.
Soldier, you must come to the king.
I’ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
You have done well by water.
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways.
I am none of his skains-mates.
Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness.
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.
But tell me, is young George Stanley living?
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.
How dost, my lord?
Which of you—if you were a prince’s son Being pent from liberty, as I am now— If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would not entreat for life?
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you?
I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.
Farewell.
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
I charge thee, tempt me not.
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.
Come now, keep thine oath.
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
And I another So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on ’t.
What Conrade!
Away, make haste.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?
For whose sake did I that ill deed?
Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.
Tell me at whose suit.
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

All is lost!
If I should speak, She would mock me into air.
I will die, And leave him all.

Certain, men should be what they seem.

For often, with a solemn earnestness— More than indeed belonged to such a trifle— He begged of me to steal it.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly.—Heaven and earth, Must I remember?
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.
What, art thou hurt?
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
M”—why, that begins my name.
Would I were satisfied!
Why should he not?
Well, let it strike.
It shall be done.
He is too disputable for my company.
Why, in good time.  
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
But I do see you’re moved.
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
What then?
My Lord of Warwick, here is, praised be God for it, a most contagious treason come to light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s day.
Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.—God save you, gentlemen!
Thou makest me merry.
Caesar, I shall.
Why ask you this?
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.
But how hath she received his love?
O day untowardly turned!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
A very forward March-chick!
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.
What do you see?
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
What is his name?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?” And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit.
Not when I saw ’t.
Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.
Has he never before sounded you in this business?
Do not deny to him that you love me.
Yes, Cassius.
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters.
I am constant to my purpose.
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
What, what, good cheer!
Let him not come near me.
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.
Lo thee!
Masters, never speak, we charge you, let us obey you go with us.
If you’ll sit down, I’ll bear your logs the while.
I could say she were worse.
Set on thy wife to observe.
Now my spirit is going.
thieves!
Legged like a man and his fins like arms!
No, not till a hot January.
The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek.
Tyranny is dead!
You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, “These are their reasons.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.
Ay, past all surgery.
Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha?
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse.
This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me.
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
With him is Gratiano gone along.
I did not.
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
Dexterously, good madonna.
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
Let’s follow, Gertrude.
Put your torches out.
What are you?
But hush, no more.
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again.
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.
How hast thou lost thy breath?
Villain, not for thy life!
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.
A sovereign shame so elbows him.
If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overruled.
The business of this man looks out of him.
Give him this letter.
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
You always end with a jade’s trick.
Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more.
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts.
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
He is well paid that is well satisfied.
But down.
O, fie, fie, fie!
Sir, sir, sir—
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use!
You are welcome.
Did he not say my brother was fled?
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t.
Who does beguile you?
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Aragon.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted.
How now, Cassio!
Good morrow, noble sir.
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
Rebels it at these years?
Alas, what is the matter?
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other’s love.
Is it not like the king?
What!
Either send the chain, or send me by some token.
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
At mine own house, good lady.
Who brought it?
Fly?
Set it by a while.
Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy.
Therefore this project
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly.
Why then, thou hast it.
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.
Let me be clear of thee.
Then wherefore should I doubt?
O God!
What?
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?
They must take it in sense that feel it.
You’ll win two days upon me.
Neither, my lord.
A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— Oh, heavens forfend!
You shall have some part of your will.
To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar 
Who’s there?
Show ’s the way, sir.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching.
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company?
And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen, good my lord, For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant.
Kill!
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, The true succeeders of each royal house, By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together, And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave.
It does, my boy.
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Look to the lady.
Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.
We would have all such offenders so cut off, and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.
Come, I’ll go in with you.
Come by and by to my chamber.
Excellent!
I pray you, pardon me.
Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.

Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.

Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany, Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new-repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant.
It is my day, my life.
Thou know’st where I will tarry.
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Tis my picture.
Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick the married man”?
Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer.
Thou dost snore distinctly.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
Zounds, who is there?
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
So I hope.
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel.
I’ll catch it ere it come to ground.
So was I when your Highness banished him.
would you create me new?
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
Horrible sight!
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
O mighty Caesar!
I afeard of him!
Oh, rarely base!
Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.
We speak no treason, man.
If she be a traitor, Why so am I.
Come not near Casca.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Carthage?
Ready, my lord.
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.
They say there’s but five upon this isle.
See, your wife’s with him.
Some to the common pulpits, and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!” People and senators, be not affrighted.
Pray God it be, sir.
Peace!
You.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
What says your Highness to my just request?
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
Now, where’s my wife?
Signior Brabantio, ho!
Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
My dagger, little cousin?
Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.
My wits faints.
It looks a little paler.
I hear his trumpet.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
Who did strike out the light?
You are i' the right, sir, ’tis for my mistress.
Some good man bear him carefully from hence.
Wherefore?
All hail, great master!
Descend, brother, I say.
Where’s your father?
And when you do them—     Cassius, be content.
Death, traitor!
The duke is humorous.
Is ’t so, indeed.
Should be”—should buzz!
I hear none, madam.
I thank thee.
Oh, here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
Go, you cot-quean, go.
Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
What of that?
He comes, my lord.
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands.
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod, And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of.
I pray thee, hold thy peace.

He shall have merely justice and his bond.
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
Pray you, be careful.
Come, come, we fear the worst.
A good matter, surely.
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?
Why, then All Souls' Day is my body’s doomsday.
Ay, what else?
It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Thou art on thy deathbed.
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
What mar you then, sir?
The ship was under sail.
What is this same?
There he is.
Murder!
But life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it.
This cannot anger him.
O Pyramus, arise!
Quite dumb?
His countenance likes me not.
Sir, I lack advancement.
All’s well, sweeting, Come away to bed.— Myself will be your surgeon.
Let us take the law of our sides.
Be patient.
There’s not a piece of feather in our host— Good argument, I hope, we will not fly— And time hath worn us into slovenry.
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front; And now, instead of mounting barbèd steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
Good news, good news!
Wherefore was that cry?
Most certain.
To be your fellow You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no.
And art thou living, Stephano?
We’ll speak with thee at sea.
That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it.
This is a devil, and no monster.
No more, I pray you.
Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice.
O, let him pass.
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots.
Ay me!
Not I, I must be found.
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
And, hark!
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
This is some fellow, Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature.
Alas, alas!
So young and so untender?
I am satisfied.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
Oh, no.
Who?
Emilia, run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.— Will you go on afore?
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
What’s a drunken man like, fool?
Give me thy hand.
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes.— Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!
Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely!
I’ll tell you in your ear.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me!
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech.
I am glad on ’t.
Hence, Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee.
I once more take my leave.
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
No, lad.
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
But we are spirits of another sort.

Give me up the truth.
Well, well, well.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.

How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.
Speak, speak.

That you must teach me.
God be at your table.
I must be circumstanced.
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Here.
For, as I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, If I begin the batt'ry once again, I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd.
The cause is in my will.
By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate.
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault?
Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly. 
It did, it did.
Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.
The old man’s daughter told us all.
What shall I do?
Who shall stay you?
Away, away, be gone.
What is your pleasure, madam?
I thank you, doctor.
She’s full of most blessed condition.
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Till then, think of the world.
His highness is not well.
I dare not drink yet, madam.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
The heart is sorely charged.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, “Good porter, turn the key,” All cruèls else subscribed.

You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
You know the character to be your brother’s?
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes.
Whither are they vanished?
Is not this buckled well?
What’s she?
Where got’st thou that goose look?
I took him sleeping—that is finished too— And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest, And thereupon give me your daughter.
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.
From top to toe?
Hark!
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
Is it a true thing?
Give me my veil.
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys.
There is not chastity enough in language, Without offense, to utter them.—Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
Ay, and twenty such.
A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
What noise?
I am locked in one of them.
How have you slept, my lord?
That which is now a horse, even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water.
Bring him away.
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
A friend.
My spirits are nimble.

They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.
Let’s stab ourselves.
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
I will not swear these are my hands.
It is backed like a weasel.
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love.
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman.
A strange fish!
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
The hour of death is expiate.
My house was at the Phoenix?
I shall take it, sir.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure.
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
Go armed.
If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress.
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape.— Take with you your companions.
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. 
How beauteous mankind is!
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Our hour  Is fully out.
I shaked you, sir, and cried.
We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' th' cold ground.
Not to be endured.
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash.
What news, my lord?
I will look him and privily relieve him.
I durst not!
Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.
The cease of majesty Dies not alone, but, like a gulf, doth draw What’s near it with it.
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them.
Now I arise.
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher.
Therefore exhale.
When and where and how We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray: That thou consent to marry us today.
Good!
This is the place.
But what of that?
I am for thee straight.
Not I, my lord.
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra?
O cousin, cousin!
Fine apparition!
For better might we Have loved without this mean, if on both parts This be not cherished.
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon, Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.
It signs well, does it not?
Romeo.
Space enough Have I in such a prison.          
Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.
And fair words to them.
Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?—Oh, unhappy girl!— With the Moor, say’st thou?—Who would be a father?— How didst thou know ’twas she?—Oh, she deceives me Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred.

Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
How is ’t, my noble lord?
I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
No more.
We are for you.
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
Were it good, think you?
By Chrish, la, ’tish ill done.
O love!
Come, come, dispatch.
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
Do you know me, Father?
No.
If he awake, From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
The best?
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Carry me to the jail?
The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
Go with me, Silvius.
That hath made him mad.
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
Arise.
And I, my royal sovereign.
Her fallow leas The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery.
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that.
Let pity not be believed.” There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamor moistened.
My brother’s servants Were then my fellows.
So, so, so, so!
Give me now leave to leave thee.
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good mooncalf.
Beware the ides of March.
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
Was that mine?
Where is my Romeo?
No more.
This is open.
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Dost thou understand me, man?
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursèd womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.
Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.— Titania, music call, and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
Tis dangerous to be spoken.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
Not that I love you not.
Well, all is one.
I pray God he be not, I say.
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part.
Here’s Romeo’s man.
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
Where am I?
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, How you awake our sleeping sword of war.
O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
Dear master, I can go no further.
So please you.
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times, During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us.
Full half an hour.
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.
Hark, hark!
Stands Scotland where it did?
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.
Give me particulars.
Silver.
Observe his construction of it.
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy, And in my company my brother Gloucester, Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches.
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow, but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity.
Stay, countrymen.
Peace, ho!
I’ll call thee “Hamlet,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” O, answer me!
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t.
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy.
Yea, or to paint himself?
Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.
I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.
If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.
The King will be gone from Southampton.
My lord, that would dishonor him!
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
As she is mine, I may dispose of her— Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death—according to our law Immediately provided in that case.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.—Lord, Lord!
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
It’s nine o'clock.
Under what title shall I woo for thee, That God, the law, my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated.
I am cut to th' brains.
To him will I.
What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.
Relent?
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
My lord.
Do so.
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
Your will?
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!
Thou art armed, Gloucester.
No, it begins again.
What is the success?
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
Lie with her—that’s fulsome.
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.—Farewell, good Master Oliver, not               'Tis no matter.
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.
My name is Thidias.
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
We are yet but young in deed.
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
Cassio!
Messala, I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
For what, I pray thee?
But such officers do the king best service in the end.
Where may we set our horses?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
We please them not by land.
Princes and counties!
Fast bind, fast find.
That’s the next to do.
I will run, fiend.
Who hath he left behind him general?
I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you.
Farewell!—God knows when we shall meet again.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
Let’s see for means.
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?
What you know, you know.
What concern they?
The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife.
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.
Do you see this, O God?
No more but so?
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!
Come you from old Bellario?
Not so, my lord.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
He will not know what all but he do know.
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
My father, poorly led?
Let us to the great supper.
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her.
Wrong I mine enemies?
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage.
You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder.
Where is he, in his bed?
But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
The king, the king’s to blame.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.
Thou art the thing itself.
Stand back.
Prithee, listen well.
Take to you no hard thoughts.
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick.
Wrench his sword from him.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
I care not for good life.              
And what have kings that privates have not too, Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.
What sayst thou to me now?
Look upon Caesar.
Your name, sir, truly.
Some villain hath done me wrong.
The second cock hath crowed.
All things shall be well.
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider, Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thornbush, my thornbush; and this dog, my dog.
I drew to part them.
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt— Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
Poor men alone?
What, art thou come?—On, gentlemen, away!
All hell shall stir for this.
Great God of heaven, say amen to all!
I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.— Nor you, Lorenzo.—Jessica, nor you.
I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well.
Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast Misused ere used, by times ill-used o'erpast.
I will follow you.
Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
They lack retention.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.
How came you thus recovered?
Thank God.” A good answer.
How intend you, “practiced”?
Know I these men that come along with you?
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.
Hold, ho!
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.
Tis spoken well.
So are those crispèd snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposèd fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.
Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,— Ay, there, look grim as hell!
Where?
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Tarry, Jew.
Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son, A man well known throughout all Italy.
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man!
Nay, as they dare.
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke.
Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
Twill be naught, But let it be.
Belike this is a man of that quirk.
My lord.
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Was ever woman in this humor won?
In verity you did.—My bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.
No further, sir.
Brutus, my country’s friend.
And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me?
I prithee, boy, run to the senate house.
Amen, amen.
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were, And the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love, Comes deared by being lacked.
Where learned you this, Fool?
Tyrant, show thy face!
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted.
No?
Farewell.
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
The younger rises when the old doth fall.
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.
Killing swine.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!
Well, peace be with you.
Tis too narrow for your mind.
I prithee, be gone.                          
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
Twas a rough night.
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome.
Do you smell a fault?
Nay then, I’ll run.
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
Myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be— This is the greatest error of all the rest.
Indeed, that is out of the air.
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.
I would I were thy bird.
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.
Soft!
Yet say I, he is in love.
Are you a man?
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air.
That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search, And there will I be with him.
We’ll know all our fortunes.
To whom, my lord?
Dorset is fled to Richmond.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.—Who goes there?
How now, sir?
Take comfort.
Give me your hand.
Tis Banquo’s then.
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
What is he, Biondello?
Or stole it, rather.
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
I pray you tell me your remedy.
My lord, I take my leave.
Stanley, look to your wife.
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.
Why, no.
Chill pick your teeth, zir.
I must perforce.
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.
Read the will.
Who’s there?
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.
Fare thee well.
Nay, good Lysander.
No, rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion; And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with.
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night.
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father.
So get you hence in peace.
I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two, And ’twill be supper time ere you come there.
Where is thy husband now?
But for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.
Master, knock the door hard.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Stand to ’t.
Didst thou not kill this king?
The news is true, my lord.
Speak softly.
Do you love me?
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, “Love me and leave me not.” What talk you of the posy or the value?
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
Go, fetch me something: I’ll break ope the gate.
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake; And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth.
Bring me to Antony.
Seyton!
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed.
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.
Will you yield and this avoid Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?
How old art thou?
Let me enjoy my private.
Romeo!
Unreal mockery, hence!
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages.
Aha!
But there’s more work.
I heard nothing.
Well thought upon.
Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
Was he not here?
When all’s done, You look but on a stool.
Tis pity of him.
There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
For that he dares us to ’t.
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
Tis very true.
What, man, there are ways to recover the general again.
Farewell, my lords.
I’ll not endure it.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
Such a one is a natural philosopher.
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
Thou dost talk nothing to me.
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever—common pleasures, To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
And that’s true too.
Say that I slew them not.
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
No, lady.
Oh, lay me by my mistress' side.
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love. 
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.
Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by, And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
This to be true I do engage my life.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son.
My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table.
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity.
The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar.” Go no further.
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Ergo, Master Launcelot.
Alas, the storm is come again!
Whip him, fellows, Till like a boy, you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy.
The weight of this sad time we must obey.
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged, That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.
I am a king, my masters, know you that?
Help me, my women!
Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.
I' th' mire.
Upon mine honor, Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.
Use Desdemona well.
Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel.
Can heaven be so envious?

Avoid what is to come.
Presently.
What, will our mother come?
I could not find him at the Elephant.
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
White-livered runagate, what doth he there?
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
Oh, let us yet be merciful.
Farewell, my Desdemona.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.
If this fall into thy hand, revolve.
Prepare we for our marriage; on which day, My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath, And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath.
No, madam, no.
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.” That’s as much as to say, “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.” If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
Let’s take leave of him.
And good monsieur, have a care the honey bag break not.
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.—Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune.
Added to these, Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen, Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which, Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.

Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.
O, teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!

Nay, then.
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind.
Oh, sweet England!
Stand!
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions.
This was the most unkindest cut of all.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard and go along with me.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
What kind of help?
I know I cannot please you.
And do it with all thy heart.
The foul’st best fits My latter part of life.
That thing you speak of, I took it for a man.
Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else.
So fare you well.
Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra’s majesty, Atalanta’s better part, Sad Lucretia’s modesty.
There is means, madam.
This kindness will I show.
What, not to pray?
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
The foe vaunts in the field.
Wherein went he?
No, sir.

No, madam.
Note him, Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man, but note him.
For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found.
Well, heaven’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me?
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad.
Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester?
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence.
No more, cousin.
Why ask you?
Thou art to die.
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.

How parted he with thee?
Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn!
And mine shall.
The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
Good morrow to you both.
And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.
He passes some humors and careers.
By thee; and this thou didst return from him: That he did buffet thee and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
The man is notwithstanding sufficient.

We are blessèd in the change.
A good epithet!
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing.

It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings.
Knock you here, sir?
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.

Arise, arise, Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Hurt him in eleven places.
Honest, my lord?
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
Brother Anthony—
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.
Do you mark that, my lord?
I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore; M.O.A.I.
Here’s his dry hand up and down.
I will fetch him.
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort!

What’s here?
As strange as the thing I know not.
Do the boys carry it away?
But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you.
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside— As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.
Belovèd Regan, Thy sister’s naught.
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
But where hast thou been, then?
But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I will deliver you or else lie for you.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s.
Well, but to my choice.
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.
Nay, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
Let me see.
Well met, my lord.
No, uncle, I’ll none.
By 'r lady, I think it be so.
Thriftless ambition, that will raven up Thine own lives' means!
I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage.
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.— Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar!
For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.
I am sure I am none such.
Oh, it is my love.
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.
I am not for this ambling.
I do assure you, ’tis against my will.
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.
You, you, ay, you!

I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
No.
You appeared to me but as a common man.
My soul, and not my child!
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
This is Lucentio’s house.
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth.
I know not.
Ha!
When was it she last walked?
Followed the old man forth.
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon.
How now, my hearts!
Come, some music!
Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.
Who is ’t that cried?
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English.
Go with me and see What I can show in this.
What bastard doth not?
Is ’t good or bad?
If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?
I will, my lord.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. 
I must, she’ll rail in the street else.
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.
Her eyes are fierce, but thine Do comfort and not burn.
Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.
Marry, at the very next turning turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Good my lord.
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.
I’ll not have it so.
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Most sincerely.
That’s my noble master!
And, as you said (and wisely was it said) 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother— Since nature makes them partial—should o'erhear The speech, of vantage.
Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription.
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
Now, fellow, What is there?
Say, “the brave Antony.”                                                 The valiant Caesar!
No Thisbe do I see.
I prithee, who?
Sir, I will answer any thing.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf!
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
Rest you happy!
Let us see.
Why, thou silly gentleman!
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Come, vial.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life.
Grandam, his nurse.
Tis false.
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Let us all embrace.
I myself.
Miranda.—O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Let her know ’t.—   And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities.
I pray, sir, can you read?
O, full of danger is the duke of Gloucester, And the queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud, And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, This sickly land might solace as before.
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.
The duke must grant me that.
And so did I.
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground. 
Oh, here it is.
I will be angry.
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
Is the chair empty?
See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.
Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
Lucius!—Fast asleep?
And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion.
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.
O notable strumpet!
The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Wo, ha, ho!
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.
Methinks I hear Antony call.
I' th' air or th' earth?
Slave!
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
Fear not, my lord.
When valor preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with.
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal!
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
I have seen you both.
Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Are they married, think you?
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight. 
Ha, ha!
Hark, what noise is this?
Fly, masters!
No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.
But did’st thou see them dead?
Harry le Roy.
No, to my cabin.
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lacked gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were— To do what?
Life and these lips have long been separated.
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Speak.
Let them come in.
No, dear Queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel.
Therefore speak.
What were these?
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.
And mine a hundred and forty.
See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
Have with you.
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
Tempt him not so too far.
Never make denial.
That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
Yet I’ll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Prithee, away.
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
The arbitrament is like to be bloody.
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
Good your highness, patience.
Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.
But oh, poor Gloucester— Lost he his other eye?
Am I a coward?
Oh, who hath done this deed?
I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else.
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
Why should he call her “whore”?
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the Whore of Babylon.
Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner.
Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
Had I great Juno’s power, The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side.
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.
Show me which way.
Prithee, no more.
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Here, catch this casket.
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend, And every one doth call me by my name.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
Why, Antony.
A noble duke, in nature As in name.
What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, But poisoned flattery?
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit.
If ’twere no other— 'Tis but so, I warrant.
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways!
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show?
In each thing give him way.
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.
Com’st thou again for ransom?
She hath good leave.
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Go fetch fire.
When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man?
I dare abide no longer.
A fire, good Curtis.
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
How now, sir?
Give me my robe.
Lead me.
And so, adieu.
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.
But what of Cicero?
So be it.
Nine or ten times I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs.
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this:
Part them!
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
Why, let her except, before excepted.
Your Highness bade me ask for it today.
And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
Why, so didst thou.
Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point.
Borachio.
But I shall crave your pardon.
Thou wouldst make a good fool.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her.
Farewell.
Well aimed of such a young one.
Whither should they come?
Why, what i' devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first?
What, sigh for the toothache?
Drunk?
Peace, ho!
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
Well moused, Lion!
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man.
But, for true need— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need.
I am glad he’s come, howsoe'er he comes.
Well struck!
On, on, on, on, on!
Mustardseed.
Away!
What, ho, Brabantio!
O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t, For I am nothing, if not critical.
Know me for Brutus!
What, ho?
Begone.
You are very welcome, sir.
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven restore thee!
Dear sir, forbear!
Three thousand ducats, well.
Well, we shall see your bearing.
Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
I have not seen such a firago.
Nay, let him alone.
The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
How far’st thou, soldier?
For all the rest, They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.
I will not hold thee long.
This day I breathed first.
But I can tell why a snail has a house.
O hard condition, Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing.
You gentle Romans—     Peace, ho!
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
Ay, on mine honor.
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passèd on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Oh, out of that “no hope” What great hope have you!
I think thou dost.
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.
Yet you began rudely.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
My lord, there needs no such apology.
I am hers.
I may not, madam.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner.
He may win, And what is music then?
Take it and do ’t, and leave me for this time.
Nor I, my lord.
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments.
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
Was ever man so 'rayed?
What will you do?
Hence, away!
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
To Ireland, I.
Have I, my lord?
He lies not like the living.
Where’s my knave, my fool?—Go you, and call my fool hither. 
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
And what will you do now?
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad.
I will send for him, and question him yourself.
No going then!
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
My sight was ever thick.
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
My salad days, When I was green in judgment, cold in blood, To say as I said then.
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest.
So good night unto you all.
How otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?
I am very glad to see you.
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart.—Be merciful.
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
What mean you, madam?
The Duke in council?
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.
My father—methinks I see my father.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
All which we pine for now.
I must discontinue your company.
Pluck out his eyes.
They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
Away, go! 
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.
You look as you had something more to say.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
But now, I tell thee—keep it to thyself— This day those enemies are put to death, And I in better state than e'er I was.
Let some of my people have a special care of him.
Where’s the king?
Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood.
Know’st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
I am but hurt.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me.
Which of them shall I take?
On what compulsion must I?
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.
Come hither, Fabian.
No, Lepidus, let him speak.
Is she not proud?
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.
Come you, sir.
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs.
In, or we are spoiled.
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.
I have a device to make all well.
Well, masters, we hear our charge.
Where hast thou been, my heart?
If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.”  Why, how dost thou, man?
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods.
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
You saw they speak us fair, give us gold.
The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state, And the offender’s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice.
Your reason.
This dagger hath mista'en—for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom.
Your case is better.
So do all thoughts.
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.
I do not think ’t.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Stay and speak!
It may be so, my lord.
I say “thy husband”—dost understand the word?
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France, Dying like men though buried in your dunghills, They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven, Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger.
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome.
Here’s to thy health.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Hamlet.” This in obedience hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.
God grant we never may have need of you.
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt.
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?
Hence, horrible shadow!
My tables!—Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.

And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country, But grow like savages, as soldiers will
O Pomfret, Pomfret!
Farewell.
Here is the man.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
Farewell both.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.
What of that?
And so fare thee well.
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.
If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion.
Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun, Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made.
Who can control his fate?
Don Pedro is approached.
Nay, and most like.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
What ring gave you my lord?
How oddly thou repliest!
If you offend him, I for him defy you.
For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
I come to thee for charitable license, That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them; To sort our nobles from our common men, For many of our princes—woe the while!— Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—that’s the French bet against the Danish.

Good my lord, enter here.
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him.
Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.
Who?
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
I am their father’s mother.
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity.
There!
You know the law.
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.
But, sith I am entered in this cause so far, Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love, I will go on.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Call them again.
Come to what is important in ’t.
Ay, sir.
Let me see your eyes.
Wherefore is this?
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, Seek through your camp to find you.
Sir, shall I to this lady?
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.
He was the wretched’st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
And time is at his period.
O, you give me ill counsel.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.
He speaks well.
If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me.
But, sir, be you ruled by me.
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, That long have frowned upon their enmity.
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.
Thy love?
Y' have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed.
Be of good cheer.
Tis neither here nor there.
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign, For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: “When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag, Look back into your mighty ancestors.
I will o'erlook thy paper.
Talk you of killing?
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
Come, go along.
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
I understand thee not.
Most sure and vulgar.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet.
Here at your service.
Adieu.
Why, wherefore ask you this?
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
How wilt thou do for a father?
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
What conquest brings he home?
Muffle me, night, awhile.
Call to me All my sad captains.
I beseech you, sir, go.
I say, but mark his gesture.
Where are thy two sons?
All myself?
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought.
But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission.
What say you?
If any, speak—for him have I offended.

Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor.
Is this true?
What’s the matter, think you?
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay, For he is footed in this land already.
And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth.

Beware the ides of March.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle.
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance.
Or if not so, then here I hit it right: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
Myself?
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her.
What might you think?
O, give me leave.
God’s will and His pleasure, Captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the king.
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could— Pursue him, ho!
I am called.
O sir, content you.
This, Casca.

My name is Proculeius.
Oh, fie upon thee, strumpet!
Vex not his prescience.
Nay, come, let’s go together.
We will be satisfied!
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
Since I came hither, Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.
The time will bring it out.
Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.
Cold, cold, my girl, Even like thy chastity.
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.
He, woman.
Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.
Oh, that I were a man for his sake!
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly.
Seek it out.
You mock me, sir.
And yet she’ll kneel and pray, I have seen her do ’t.
You might do much.
That was in thy rage.
Be near me, that I may remember you.
Who will go with me?
My brother never Did urge me in his act.
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
Before the eyes of both our armies here, Which should perceive nothing but love from us, Let us not wrangle.
Oh, thou art deceived.
Sir, the gods Will have it thus.
I never spake with her in all my life.
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it.
But where was this?
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once.
You are full of pretty answers.
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.— Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace.
I hope thou art not mad.
O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy.
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial.
Comfort me.
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Great happiness!
Oh, villain that I am!
But soft!
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
Thou art a lady.
No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people.
Two of them have the very bent of honor, And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the Bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.
A piece of ice.
Bid them move away.
Dismiss me?

Well, madam, and in health.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.

Nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal.
But what’s your will?
Tis so—but Edward lives.
And she’s fair I love.

I’ll come to him.
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.
Made she no verbal question?
In her consists my happiness and thine.
What say you?
He’s worth no more.
Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed honesty.

Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them.

Romeo is coming.
The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Lechery!
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his.
Why, well.
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much.
Make you a wholesome answer.
This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies.

Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.

But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.
Tis just.
Let me shun that.
Is it a man?
One fairer than my love?
I’ll wait upon your Lordship.
Is he gone and hath nothing?
Speak not.
Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
All there is thine.
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor.
Sir, there she stands.
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught.
For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.
I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law.
Send for him, good uncle.
Thou shouldst be honest.
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Behold, I have a weapon.
I will not take her on gift of any man.
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
Am I in France?
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?
Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.
Sir, fare you well.
A right good markman!

He brings you figs.
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
She lives.
My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches.
I’ll stay no longer question.
You’ll heat my blood.
O, let me speak!
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.
Hang not on my garments.
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
We defy augury.
Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither.
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer.
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.
Here lies the east.
Ha?
First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold, Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry, In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns, In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass, and all things that belong To house or housekeeping.
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
Out, fool.
Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately.
He’s bound unto Octavia.
I’ll have grounds More relative than this.

Couple it with something.
Indeed he is not fit.
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.
Fortune now To my heart’s hope!
I thank thee for that jest.
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love.
Trow you whither I am going?
Thy luster thickens When he shines by.
Before God, and in my mind, very wise.
But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings Have lipped, and trembled kissing.
What, I say?
Did not you speak?
Stay with us.
He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Ay, my lord.
I’ll show thee the best springs.
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
And therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.
But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a prave man.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

You amaze me.

Why, what’s the matter?
A beggar, brother?

Monday, my lord.
The gods confound thee!
Come.
They have not been commanded, mighty king.
Thou dost mean something.
What else, fellow?
Poor man!
The king enacts more wonders than a man, Daring an opposite to every danger.
Here, sir!
Oh, now forever Farewell the tranquil mind!
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Get thee to a nunnery, go.
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
Come down.
More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.
He never did harm that I heard of.
In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I had done.
How if fair and foolish?
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
Romeo, away, be gone!
Not I, believe me.
She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me!
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings—” Thy yellow stockings?
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.”                                                           Well said.

I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
Do not say so, my lord.
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.
Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
What counterfeit did I give you?
I can be patient.
All’s hushed as midnight yet.

I am not furnished with the present money.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him.
Hear me, Beatrice— Talk with a man out at a window!
Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home.
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
It is the best horse of Europe.
What should I speak?
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.
About it, and write “happy” when thou’st done.
She shows a body rather than a life, A statue than a breather.
And when was he wont to wash his face?
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother.
But stop my house’s ears—I mean my casements— Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house.
Who lies i' th' second chamber?
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Yes, I intend so.
I will be faithful.
My name is Roderigo.
Then you are a better than the king.
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
Do you confess so much?
I have more cause.
Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?
Tis true.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.
Ha!
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.
Let me play the lion too.
Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman.
Yea, by Mass, that it is.
Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, And poison it in the source, and the first stone Drop in my neck.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
I know his heart.
I serve as good a man as you.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.
I know not, madam.
To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

Minion, thou liest.
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it.
Ay, he spoke Greek.
What is thy name?
It shall not need.
What would you with me, honest neighbor?
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
Who talks within there?
A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do.
Lay her i' th' earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
Should I lie, madam?
Your children shall be kings.
Name them.
Go, vanish into air, away!
Now I am alone.
Hob, nob, is his word.
Down with him, thief!
Let me be your servant.
Adieu.
Tis better as it is.
I know you of old.
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Caesar, thou art revenged, Even with the sword that killed thee.
Good morrow to you.
Woe, woe for England!
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.
Is your man secret?
How easy is it, then!
Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
In most profound earnest, and, I’ll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.
You mar our labor.
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.
Caesar’s will?
O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us.
Give me thy hand.
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Here comes the Emperor.
Armed, say you?
Woo’t thou fight well?
Enobarbus, welcome.
He is composed and framed of treachery, And fled he is upon this villainy.
He did, from first to last.
No.
For certain, sir, he is not.
He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his.
Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
For he partly begs To be desired to give.
I think he be angry indeed.
And what wilt thou do—beg when that is spent?
Do not so.
I know not, lady.
They shout for joy.
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
A good swift simile, but something currish.
Small joy have I in being England’s queen.
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse, Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon.
Give him this deed, And let him sign it.
And I have heard Apollodorus carried—                                                                               What, I pray you?

Therefore get you on and give him his desire.
Hark, canst thou hear me?
Welcome.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

Most certain.
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.
That’s a degree to love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
Take it, brave York.
Good Lord for alliance!
Go, Sir Andrew.
He cannot speak, my lord.
Faith, her privates we.
What’s done is done.
Liar and slave!
Good madam, let me see your face.
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
Why is your cheek so pale?
Woe that too late repents!—   Is it your will?
Oh, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
What two crowns shall they be?
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself.
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
If they do this, As, if God please, they shall, my ransom then Will soon be levied.
Let it be so.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours.
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold.
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. 
Hast thou the flower there?
Madam, here comes my lord.
The gallants desire it.
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go?
We look for you tomorrow.
Noblest of men, woo’t die?
Come, shall we about it?
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
Thou liest.
This was a merry message.
Nay, I have done.
That nature, which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
I have heard it said so.
I hope she will be brief.
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
And now forward with thy tale.
How now, my sweet Bianca!
Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.
Wake her not.
O rude unthankfulness!
There’s hope in ’t yet.
But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her If she refuse me.
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground.
Tis time that I were gone.
Farewell.
It hath made me mad.
Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and a fool.
As thick as tale Can post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense, And poured them down before him.
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
Upon the stroke of four.
What sayest thou?
Pray you, away.
Lights, lights, lights!
I do not like the office.
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there.
Take up those cords.—Poor ropes, you are beguiled, Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber, ay’ll de gud service, or I’ll lig i' th' grund for it, ay, or go to death.
Give me mine angle.
Death is my son-in-law.
Here comes my messenger.—How now, mad spirit?
O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars.
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.
Well are you welcome to the open air.
Fly And make your peace with Caesar.
One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam.
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me.
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
Ay, that Petruchio came.
Peace, ho!
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Let her hang me.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
It proves not so.
Under a compelling occasion, let women die.
O, cry your mercy, sir.—        Tom’s a-cold.
Is thy master coming?
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.
Yea, very force entangles Itself with strength.
No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
What means this jest?
Look in the almanac.
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow.—Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Now he begins the story.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Masters, do you serve God?
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it.
Go we to him.
Let’s follow.
Come.
Arise, dissembler.
My mind is changed.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
Excellent good.
On thy love, I charge thee.
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.
But it is no matter.
Well, as you guess?
Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
We will, my noble lord.
I fear thee not.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
So the spirit is eased.
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
All this done, Repair to Pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.
I’ll go with you.
Troth, no, no more than reason.
Who’s there?
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions.
Nothing.
This is old.
I will chop her into messes!
None but friends.
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?
She has light by her continually.
But shall ’t be shortly?
Therefore be double damned, Swear thou art honest!
Some tender money to me; some invite me; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses; Some offer me commodities to buy.
What’s he?
Whom should I knock?
I hear the minstrels play.
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I would he knew that I had saved his brother.
Your grace hath laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
What is it ye would see?
Yet you are withered.
Mine would, sir, were I human.
We are three of them.
My lord, I did, But answer made it none.
Ay, my good lord.
My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted My grievèd ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return.
Go, go, dispatch.
I did hear The galloping of horse.
Good old knight, Collect them all together at my tent.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.
It was his bidding.
Do so.
By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company.
Hast thou affections?
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “An you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not.
If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him and show him all our reasons.
At a word, I am not.
Now, if you love me, stay.
What wood is this before us?
And that you would have me to do!
But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o' th' season.
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
But, let me see, by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
Would I were assured Of my condition.
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Why—after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat—the two crowns of the egg.
Tis true, most worthy signior.
Arise, you shall not kneel.
The gods withhold me!
Helen, it is not so.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.
You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
And me too, good Lord!
Answer as I call you.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?
At our synagogue, Tubal. 
Where’s Romeo?
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
Madam, I trust, not so.
Cassius, Be not deceived.
He needs not.
Oh!
I did.
I am glad of it.
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I’d shake it on this quarrel.
What, the chain?
Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Go, be gone.
God’s bread!
What say the augurers?
What ho, the Emperor’s guard!
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
These griefs and losses have so bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.— Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor.
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too!
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for.
O gull!
I’ll find Romeo To comfort you.
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
What is ’t thou canst demand?
A conduit, girl?
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You’ll have enough.
I say, by sorcery he got this isle.
How does lieutenant Cassio?
How far that little candle throws his beams!
What have you done?
I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
Thou villain, what sayest thou?
And all my children?
But let them measure us by what they will.
Be not too late.
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em.
Go thou.
She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.
I marvel why I answered not again.
We cannot be here and there too.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Lucentio!
Never believe it.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.— Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo.
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above.
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats: Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you.
So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
Heaven knows what she has known.
If God will be avengèd for this deed, O, know you yet He doth it publicly!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
I’ll not endure it.
Do not presume too much upon my love.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give.
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.
Post-post-haste, dispatch.
I’ll give ’t him.
Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits.
Will you have her?
What’s that good for?
No, you shall paint when you are old.
No man must know.” If this should be thee, Malvolio?
With all my heart.—Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.— Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
Sola!
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.
There’s nothing in her yet.
There’s not, I think, a subject That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Went he hence now?
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.
Ay, sir, they be ready.
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.
I robbed his wound of it.
I know not.
Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks.
Well, we will leave you then till dinnertime.
Pardon, dear father.
What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win.
Gone?
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.
And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— By the bad voice.
Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant.
Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
What I can do I will, and more I will Than for myself I dare.
And died so?
When they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
Signior?
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.
I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him.
He has brave utensils—for so he calls them— Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
I say, it is not lost.
Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls.
Tis with cares.
Thou'rt a scholar.
Or neither?
So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London.
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!
But small to greater matters must give way.
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be.
Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
Not a whit, Touchstone.
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities, with a learnèd spirit, Of human dealings.
There’s enough.
Life, living, all is Death’s.
Is it a world to hide virtues in?
Besides, our hands are hard.
Why, what make you here?
He is ready at the door.
Is the king dead, the empire unpossessed?
Whither away?
Thy mother’s poisoned.
In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point- devise the very man.
Come, sit on me.
Off with his son George’s head!
O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight, The grave doth gape, and doting death is near.
Come hither, fellow.
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news.
Yet hear me, countrymen.
For several virtues Have I liked several women.
No offense i' th' world.
Thou 'rt kind.
Every man look o'er his part.
Why, because he was mad.
Draw the curtain straight.
I see thou know’st me not.
Yes, in truth it is, sir.
Madam, he’s well.
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law?
Not so, my lord.
Juliet!—Fast, I warrant her, she.— Why, lamb!
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.
Didst thou hear these verses?
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you.
How poor are they that have not patience!
O the blessed gods!
What needs more words?
That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
No, you shall pardon me.
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.
A most scurvy monster.
Shame of ladies, sisters!
Fare you well.
Art thou my son?
Return with her?
You will lose this wager, my lord.
Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness offered.
Who comes here?
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Caesar, all hail!
Go put on thy defenses.
Peace!
The letters that he speaks of  May be my friends.
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon.
You talk!
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!
And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.
That’s certain—if the devil may be her judge.
I loved you not.
Why, it stood by her.
This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
Who’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
A crow without feather?
Stop her there!
Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies.
A very fine one.
And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow?
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Farewell, everyone.
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.
Oh, ’twill be admirable!
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
Give me answer to it.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings.
I am right loath to go.
O my son, my son!
But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well.
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end, Fading in music.
Lovers, to bed.
They have made worms' meat of me.
We’ll mend our dinner here.
Treason!
I know thee not.
Oh, that brave Caesar!
You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered—what shall I do?
He shall enlarge him.
Well then, sustain me.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
Most wonderful!
Deny to speak with me?
By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
Be ruled.
When I desire their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.
Up, my lords.
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us.
Forever and a day.
Why, how now, cousin!
Where wilt thou lead me?
I may say “thrusting” it, For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.
What cheer?
Not one, my lord.
Friar!
The captain— Give it the captain.
Therein the patient Must minister to himself.
But yet I’ll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate.
He looks gentler than he did.
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives Of me for jests; but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me.
Where are they?
My mother.
Why, for that too.
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
I, gentle mistress.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
Tis well you offer it behind her back.
M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.
Silence!
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.
Help, help, help!
What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness.
Neither.
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.
And what say’st thou then to my love?
An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.
What handkerchief?
I am sorry I beat thee.
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.
It is.
What mean’st thou by that?
Let them come before Master Constable.
No “master,” sir, but a poor man’s son.
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia: her years, Her inclination.
My wits begin to turn.—   Come on, my boy.
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge.
Be it so.
Here’s yet some liquor left.  
It is so.
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.
I was adored once too.
Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!
By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard, I would not shave ’t today.
I do not like your faults.
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.— Come hither, Moor.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
Take thy forfeiture.
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
The princess is the better Englishwoman.—I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
Indeed, they are disproportioned.
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss.”
I will hence tonight.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' th' beam should bow.
And in good time, Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart.
As manhood shall compound.
Enter, sir, the castle.
She was here even now.
Is he dead?
I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant.
With drinking healths to my niece.
What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?
Unbutton here.
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.
O Cassius, Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.
But come, your Bergomask.
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
Signor Bassanio!
Tomorrow or next day they will be here.
Yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.
In which regard,
That’s mercy, but too much security.
Oh, I am out of breath in this fond chase.
What men daily do, not knowing what they do!
This is well.
Thou shalt not choose but go.
The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had, my lords.
And to sink in it, should you burthen love— Too great oppression for a tender thing.
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.
When Caesar says, “do this,” it is performed.
Do you not know I am a woman?
Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.
Well, I say no.
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.
Good madam, stay a while.
A surgeon!
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love.
I confess two sleeves.
Well then, go you into hell?
There’s no offense, my lord.
Believe what?
My mistress, sir,” quoth I.
Look, look.
They say, one Taurus.
No more of that.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
Tarry, rash wanton.
O heavy deed!
Canidius, Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse.
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one.
Look, he wears cruel garters.
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”  Where, good Mistress Mary?
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies.
Doth not the day break here?
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
I’ll go farther off.
When have I injured thee?
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits.
Is it his use?
I cannot love him.
Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit!
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death?
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
Nay, hear him.
Caesar, I will.
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
When did I see thee so put down?
Sir, I commend you to your own content.
Didst thou not say he lied?
Grace go with you, sir.
The fool will stay.
But where is Kate?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
She has robbed me of my sword.
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal.
Yet again?
What, were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is, in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage.
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath, Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city.
And thither will I straight to visit him.
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage.
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
If they will fight with us, bid them come down, Or void the field.
Away with the dotard!
My brother Gloucester’s voice.—Ay, I know thy errand.
I shall obey you.
O, reform it altogether!
And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places.
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.
Lo, now, lo!
O all you host of heaven!
Do you know them?
That’s more to me than my wetting.
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.
Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity.

Change you color?
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.
You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you.
By my life, I do.

You’d be king o' th' isle, sirrah?
I have it ready for thee.

He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His grace not being warned thereof before.
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
And here my mistress.
How comes this trick upon him?
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
What an eye she has!

But what’s your jest?
I care not if I have.
Your mind may change.

Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.
You whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Now quit you well.—             Torches, torches!

And your horse now would make him an ass.
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me.

Remember that you call on me today.
Adieu, Till your return at night.
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines?
Thy business?

What may I call your name?
How now, Grumio?
Mercy, mercy!

Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Would ’twere done.
Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure.

Near and on speedy foot.
Certainly, sir, I can.

And all my armor laid into my tent?
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband.
Cassio knows you not.

He is welcome hither.
Of lusty earls: Grandpré and Roussi, Faulconbridge and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
Long stayed he so.

So said, so done, is well.
Now, good sweet Nurse— O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.— Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.

Yours by this hand.
And let the wise man fly.
So the fool follows after.

Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently.
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?
I like it not.
How?
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
It is my duty, sir.
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music.
No, It is thyself, mine own self’s better part, Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart, My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim, My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
Well, well, away.
My lord shall never rest, I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.
Tis the curse of service.
Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Thou art a boil, A plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble.
How now, interjections?
I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon.
Is thy master stirring?
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone.
Now heaven walks on earth.
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.
What cheer, my love?— Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.
Good e'en, brother.
This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use.
Why dost thou call him “knave”?
O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
I know thy quality.
You have among you many a purchased slave, Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules— You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them.
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty.
Was ’t not the way?
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
I will kiss thy lips.
Nay, it is.
You, as your business and desire shall point you— For every man has business and desire, Such as it is—and for my own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.
Still so constant, lord.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear ’t that th' opposèd may beware of thee.
What is the matter, masters?— Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving, Speak, who began this?
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver.
Hark.
What man is that?
One aloof stand sentinel.
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?
This is nothing, Fool.
Not if the small come first.
Speak.
Almost afraid to know itself.
I’ll be thy second.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandoned from your bed.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
How idly do they talk!
I would know that.
A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord.
O my good master!
Not Hermia but Helena I love.
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Not a mouse stirring.
And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars, And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
Stand, you neat slave, strike!
Of all the days i' the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
The table’s full.
Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
No, my good knight.
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
No news of them?
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither masked.
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.
One thing more rests, that thyself execute, to make one among these wooers.
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.— Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For in my mind you are much bound to him.
Why, shall we turn to men?
Who is ’t that can inform me?
Charmian, hark.
Approach, Sir Andrew.
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.
Grave sir, hail!
God give him joy!
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh.
Run away, I pray you!
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
And I for Ganymede.
Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails.
That which I gave you.
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Where is she?
For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home.
No, not tonight.
Say, my spirit, How fares the king and ’s followers?
I wear it for a memorable honor, For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Good repose the while!
Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes.
Why of thy thought, Iago?
Come, come.
You cannot feed capons so.
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap?
Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again.
Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
A plague o' both your houses!
Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!
Go to.
Thou art sure of me.
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion.
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er!
But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons, Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth A deep repentance.
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
To what end?
Be gone!
Call my guard, I prithee.
Then we are rid of Litio.
How is ’t, Laertes?
A mighty strength they carry.
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore.
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed.
When Prospero is destroyed.
Come, my sweet Kate.
Nay, that’s certain.
What is to be said to him, lady?
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.
O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.
That is he.
Shall we shog?
Draw up your powers.
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.
My name is Pistol called.
Welcome, my lord.
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
I set him there, sir, but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement.
My face I’ll grime with filth, Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots, And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky.
It is my birthday.
For God’s sake, take a house.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.
O excellent young man!
Now is the day we long have lookèd for.
Good dawning to thee, friend.
O God!—O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
Here, Peter Quince.
Not altogether so, sir.
O royal Caesar!
We would not die in that man’s company That fears his fellowship to die with us.
My gracious sovereign.
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living.
Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— Your name, I beseech you, sir?
He sought my life, But lately, very late.
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.
O lamentable day!
Why then, God forgive me.
Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant.
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
It is very sultry—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.
Well, get thee gone.
A spirit, a spirit.
Strike!
But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death, “Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead.
Lord of lords!
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
Godden to your Worship, good Captain James.
By th' clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least.
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are.
Didst perceive?
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.
They are winged.
Oh, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world.
Wrinkles forbid!
You rise to play and go to bed to work.
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
Soft, here follows prose.
An interlude!
Discern’st thou aught in that?
Now might I do it pat.
Much will be seen in that.
We would be resolved, Before we hear him, of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France.
Oh, I have read it.
Is this the Prince’s brother?
These many, then, shall die.
What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
But all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
Or do you but counterfeit?
There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of the greatest note Seems bruited.
Any strange beast there makes a man.
Here comes the lady.
Ay, sir.
I think our father will hence tonight.
We are friends.
Comes there any more of it?
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment.
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
For the table, sir, it shall be served in.
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Is this face Hero’s?
Why, I said nothing.
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.
Is ’t not your trick?
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
Do not you chide.
What else?
Indeed, he is so.
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
Hush!
Peace, Smulkin.
What make you from home?
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.
Look you for any other issue?
Do not, Phoebe.
I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against Benedick.
Some other time.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
But this it is: our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us.
Marry them to your heirs!
But that you do not love me.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain.
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles.
Alas the day!
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee.
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.
Shake!” quoth the dovehouse.
I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.
Yet thou didst kill my children.
After so long grief, such nativity!
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Let’s talk.
Lie thou there.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
Do, young sir.
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor.
If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you.
Godspeed, fair Helena!
I never sued to friend, nor enemy; My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word.
The king is full of grace and fair regard.

What, so brief?
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
I say, remember.

How low am I?
Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

A gentleman.
I would not see ’t.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him.
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him, Th' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child, And both the princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
Be quiet and depart.
Go to, go to.
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands.
See thou dissemble not.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry, But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more we should ourselves complain.
So quick bright things come to confusion.
Keep me in temper.
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
Send for the county.
Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever?

Perchance he will not mind me.
He came too late.
If he were dead, what would betide on me?
Then shall we be news-crammed.
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power.
Well, thou dost best.
That head, my lord?
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloody days again, And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Not tonight, good Iago.
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters, Killing them twice.
All eyes!
What we will do, we do upon command.
The king and queen and all are coming down.
Farewell.

Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
For with throwing thus my head,  Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
Sir, speed you.
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!
Why, right, you are in the right.
Not I.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Up and down, up and down,  I will lead them up and down.

Farewell.
News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!
Why are you drawn?
If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me.
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. 
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
Till then sit still, my soul.
If it be so as so ’tis put on me— And that in way of caution—I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor.

I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
Nor will you tender less.
She is cunning past man’s thought.
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed, having so good a mean.
I prithee, put them off.

Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master.
You’ll let us in, I hope?

Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
Dost thou mock me?
There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known.
Shut doors after you.
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
Murder!
So can I.
Upon what sickness?
What noise is that?
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Hail, most dear Caesar!
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
Why, sir, a carpenter.
Had I a glass, I would.
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.
How is it with her?
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.
Contending with the fretful elements.
But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o'er.
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
I do not think there is any such woman.
An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate.
O, then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness.
Note this before my notes: There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.
Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?
Tis he.
Take heed o' th' foul fiend.
Not know my voice!
So the gods preserve thee!
She hath prevented me.
Kill men i' th' dark!
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold.
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
Hark, hark!
It is a pretty youth—not very pretty— But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes him.
But, soft!
Is ’t come to this?
Pray you, tell him I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him The greatness he has got.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you.
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
You do but dally.
I’ll court his favors.
I am very glad to see you, signior.
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.
Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth.
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is baked with frost.
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.
You must play Pyramus.—And Flute, you Thisbe.
Give us kind keepers, heavens!
Who’s there?
I fear your disposition.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it.
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
Soft, sir!
Some men there are love not a gaping pig, Some that are mad if they behold a cat, And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, Cannot contain their urine.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Nor I.
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?
For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?
This found I on my tent this morning.
Give me a torch.
Here is yet a postscript.
Would he deny his letter, said he?
I am but mad north-north-west.
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.
As of a man faithful and honorable.
Lives, sir.
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited.
Will you two help to hasten them?
Will ’t please your highness walk?
I muse why she’s at liberty.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.
Why, how now, Dromio.
You lack a man’s heart.
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.
He was not merry, Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both.
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more.
By this hand, I am.
Such as I am, I come from Antony.
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart—     I must prevent thee, Cimber.
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
Dromio—thou, Dromio—thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
How I dote on thee!
Yes, by heaven!
Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The king my father wracked.
For my part, I care not.
You’re fall’n into a princely hand.
A most high miracle!
So long?
Go.
Therefore turn and draw.
Who calls so loud?
How now, fellow?
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all!—I am glad to see thee well.—Welcome, good friends.—O old friend?
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
Be thy mouth or black or white,  Do-de, de-de.
We know each other’s faces; for our hearts, He knows no more of mine than I of yours, Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.— Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
This same is she, and I do give you her.
What said he when he came unto himself?
Why is this “impawned,” as you call it?
Prithee, see there!
Adieu, good neighbor.
Help, help, O, help!
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air, We’d fight there too.
O woeful day, O woeful day!
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Oh, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Come, go with me; Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me.
The fellow has good judgment.
Stand not amazed.
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?
Bring me word how tall she is.
And we will hear it.
Set me where you stand.
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.
See how beastly she doth court him!
Now, unto thy bones good night!
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee.
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you.
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
That will I do.
If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may.
O most courageous day!
I wis, your grandam had a worser match.
But for his purpose in the coronation, I have not sounded him, nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein.
Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.
What, art mad?
O Antony, Antony, Antony!
Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will.
Hence “banishèd” is banished from the world, And world’s exile is death.
And I for no woman.
Is not this man jealous?
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared.
Yes, ’tis Emilia.— 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death, The noise was high.
It is, my lord.
The knave counterfeits well.
What, what?
It nothing ill becomes thee.— Aboard my galley I invite you all.
My language!
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Come hither, good Volumnius.
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
And I.
O true, good Catesby.
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.
Where do I dwell?
Let’s not consort with them.
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?
What a blow was there given!
What, ho!
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?
I am not to you known, Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
Why are you grown so rude?
I’ll confine myself no finer than I am.
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter.
How shall I know thee again?
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
So I will, my liege, as I live.
And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture.
Scurvy knave!  
Go, And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her.
My lord, you know I love you.
I pray you, master, tell me?
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Fears and scruples shake us.
Even so great men great losses should endure.
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in.
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen?
Alexas!
He brings great news.
You tremble and look pale.
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
Moon and stars!
He sings at grave- making. 
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
Tut, I like it not.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.
Do ’t, knight.
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive.
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned?
Die for adultery?
And they have conspired together.
I will to Egypt.
Bid them all fly, For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all.
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, And by the doom of death end woes and all.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Lives my sweet son?
Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all.
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
I have a suit to you.
My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid.
I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.
Oh, heaven forgive us!
Who’s that?
Go to.
Kiss him for that, good widow.
Go, hang yourselves all!
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Yes, sooth, and so do you.
Charmian!
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested.
Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.
Go and tell them so.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
With the earl, sir, here within.
Take your place.
Ill will never said well.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.
Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned.
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.
He shall see none to fear.
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
Draw, you rogue, for though it be night yet the moon shines.
Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
Downy windows, close,
Did we, my lord?
Whose house?
This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can.
Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.
Here’s a change indeed!
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Cassio shall have my place.
Indeed?
Count Claudio?
What, is the fellow mad?
What is Thisbe?
No, Antony, take the lot.
You may gather more.
No, by mine honor, madam.
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?
Oh, rare for Antony!
Ay, and briefly.
Fie, Fie, lieutenant, You’ll be ashamed for ever.
Most monsterlike be shown For poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her preparèd nails!
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
Ay.
Despise me If I do not.
In happy time.
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.
Mine honor was not yielded, But conquered merely.
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him.
Demand me nothing.
God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
Let be.
How appears the fight?
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest?
Remember thee!
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop?
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so.
I’ll send my prayers with him.
An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.
Ho, open the door.
All’s one.
Give me a cup of wine.
The testament!
Hear you, my lords—     We have some haste, Leonato.
When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— O Romeo, that she were!
Oh!
I pray you all, If you have hitherto concealed this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still.
But his flawed heart— Alack, too weak the conflict to support— 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly.
Where are they?
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.
Go to your rest.
Were you by when it began?
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.
I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood.
I never hurt you.
Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, He makes for England, here to claim the crown.
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
Give me, give me!
He did receive his letters and is coming.
What stay had I but Edward?
I have heard my father name him.
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die, meantime Laugh at his challenge.
Know thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune (Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies Brought to this shore.
Ay, madam.
Oh, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him.
He says he’ll come.
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
Then I’ll be brief.
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.
Gold, silver, and base lead.
What is your name?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
No, let me not.
Is ’t true?
How say you now?
You know not why we came to visit you— Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.
See how they kiss and court!
What news?
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
Nay, that’s certain.
Come, sirs.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?
Let me see, let me see.
Tell not me.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change.
I’ll not meddle with him.
Here comes the good Macduff.
I long with all my heart to see the prince.
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
We know what belongs to a watch.
E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.
You shall know more hereafter. 
That ever holds.
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.
And of women.
He would not?
And that’s but unwholesome food, they say.
This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile.
If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance.
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so.
I am his brother, and I love him well.
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him.
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well.
Did I not meet thy friends?
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?
Here, Peter Quince.
And here’s another, whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on.
He would not have spoke such a word.
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
Royal Queen!
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world?
What’s your name?
Soft, comes he not here?
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
What, master, read you?
Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Their malady convinces The great assay of art, but at his touch— Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand— They presently amend.
No more of drowning, do you hear?
I do know him by his gait.
Come, go in.
But here comes Antony.
Are we all ready?
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.
Thou’dst shun a bear, But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou’dst meet the bear i' th' mouth.
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious, Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers.
I know you not.
What handkerchief?
Who is ’t that calls?
Go, go.
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled.
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.
What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed, To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness?
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away.
I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.
I humbly thank you, sir.
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus.
Monster, I will kill this man.
Moneys is your suit.
Come, be a man.
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am pressed unto it.
Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation?
Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay, For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.
And make him with fair Ægles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Not that we love words better, as you do.
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.
You are unkind, Demetrius.
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
Will you give her o'er?
Montague!
What say you sir?
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue!
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.
What sum owes he the Jew?
Welcome, my lord.
Lord, what though?
Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
What was your dream, my lord?
Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none? 
But what trade art thou?
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was.
Besides, in mercy, The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance, that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where, wretches, their poor bodies Must lie and fester.
Make that good.
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago.
Pray, write down, “Borachio.”—Yours, sirrah?
How, my pretty York?
My news I might have told hereafter.
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted.
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
But brother Anthony—     Come, ’tis no matter.
No, it is struck.
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
Why, farewell, Portia.
Why the devil came you between us?
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Why, that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents.
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
What I should deny— As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce My very character—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice.
Certain ones, then.
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels.
You do assist the storm.
Why, what should you fear?
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.
I think it be, sir.
Oh, ho!
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is.
Remain thou still in darkness.
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.
I do consent—    Prick him down, Antony.
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
Fear nothing.
Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?
But for the bloody napkin?
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now.
Both sides are even.
Patience, gentle Audrey.
Then God be blessed, it is the blessèd sun.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I’ll kill him.
Why, what should be the fear?
By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions.
Who brought it?
I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged, Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, That fear attends her not.
Ha?
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
Oh, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it!
I do not like her name.
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war, and there is an end. 
For my part, the sea cannot drown me.
Let still the woman take An elder than herself.
Please you, farther.
I charge you, go with me.
Methought I had, and often did I strive To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air, But smothered it within my panting bulk, Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
You forget yourself To hedge me in.
But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.
He breathes, my lord.
What, we have many goodly days to see!
No, not a grize.
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.
What do you mean?
Peace!
But if I give my wife a handkerchief— What then?
What say you?
He’ll fright you up, i' faith.
If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor, The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Th' occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head.
I will none of your money.
He hath given his empire Up to a whore; who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war.
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
The will!
Hear you the news abroad?
I’ll be with thee betimes.
Oh, the good gods!
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
Come, sir, will you aboard?
He followed you.
Seafaring men, sir.
Brown, madam, and her forehead As low as she would wish it.
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
How oddly he is suited!
Apollo plays, And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep?
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
This gentleman will out-talk us all.
Thou praisest the worst best.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
Do not go forth today.
He is afeard to come.
An if the wind blow any way from shore, I will not harbor in this town tonight.
All is not well.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage.
Where is Duncan’s body?
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Though I wish thy death, I will not be the executioner.
Sirs, take up the corse.
Out, loathèd medicine!
Heaven doth truly know it.
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest.
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.
Fetch me an iron crow.
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to the encounter, Or whether ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.
Besides, it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it.
Heaven preserve you!
Sound, trumpet!
Was ever woman in this humor wooed?
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
The French have reinforced their scattered men.
Methinks I do.
He holds me well.
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great.
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of.
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.
I’ll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.
For what purpose, love?
Did you say with Cassio?
I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself.
No?
Stay, gentle Helena.
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception.
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? 
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
Give you good night.
Again!
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.
You must say “paragon.” A “paramour” is, God bless us, a thing of naught.
How long hath she been thus?
Have you a mind to sink?
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
Farewell, for I must leave you.
Lead, monster; we’ll follow.
Is the storm overblown?
How now?
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
That’s all one.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad.
I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your wooing.— Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But “banishèd” to kill me?—“Banishèd”!
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide.
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Do not laugh at me, For as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child Cordelia.
I thank God, I thank God!
Did he confess it?
What manner of man?
But have I not cause to weep?
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.
If you should die before him, where’s her dower?
In your dumps?
Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.
You are a fishmonger.
Will you have me, lady?
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
How may that be?
Bear free and patient thoughts.
Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily.
Oh, how I love thee!
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot.
We have engaged ourselves too far.
Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
I have done no harm.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house.
No, sir.
And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar.
Now art thou my lieutenant.
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
I am not sorry neither.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
Ay, two hours together.
They are coming to the play.
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
But I have none.
Tis true.
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.
I defy lechery.
Yet the gold bides still That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Have you any further trade with us?
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
I fear ’tis choleric.
Come, hang them on this line.
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
If she find him not, To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.
Tis midnight.
I am only sorry  He had no other death’s-man.
For both, my lord.
Not yet.
For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And, thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded?
Alas the day!
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool.
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
Call you me “fair”?
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
Oh, fie, fie, fie!
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.
So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe.
You have heard much.
Sir, this is the matter—  I beseech you, remember— Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.
He hath confessed.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
And, as I am an honest Puck,  If we have unearnèd luck  Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,  We will make amends ere long.
You best know the place.
I will acquit you.
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.
The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario.
Here, my good lord.
He comes to kill my heart.
Why, what effects of passion shows she?  
That would hang us, every mother’s son.
Why?
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic— As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.
Le Roy?
Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.
Here comes the little villain.
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound.
If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue.
Ay, Lepidus.
Let me not stay a jot for dinner.
And the creature run from the cur?
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world.
My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.
Their names are pricked.
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither, For he was fitter for that place than earth.
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do.
Let’s to billiards.
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, And I will give you audience.
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous, And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!
Out, tawny Tartar, out!
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered.
It is not yet near day.
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s myself, It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, Or e'er I journey to your father’s house.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat? 
It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
Alas, and woe!
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.
We will be married o' Sunday.
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got, as I take it, an ague.
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told.
What’s that?
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
You are an ass, you are an ass!
I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die.
They say this town is full of cozenage, As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many suchlike liberties of sin.
You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
Come like shadows; so depart!
Wherefore storm you so?
Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep.
And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides?
Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
And, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
I have a thing for you.
But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Yea, art thou there?
Good morrow to this fair assembly.
For us, we will consider of this further.
Do, do.
How, how, Cordelia?
How lush and lusty the grass looks!
I’ll none of it.
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
There, Diomed, there.
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Whither away?
Pish!
Now heaven hath all,
Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.
The king, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay.
It is worth the pains.
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones.
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.
Monster, lay to your fingers.
How now, my lord!
What think’st thou then of Stanley?
O piteous spectacle!
If without peril it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note.
Go, get thee hence.
My cousin Westmoreland?
By what rule, sir?
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
Ay, madam.
Farewell, hostess.
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
Who wrongs him?
But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance.
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s?
Here, wear this jewel for me.
But is he often thus?
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love.
Who does do you wrong?
I say thy husband.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.
You understand me?
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town, Beheaded publicly for his offense.
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
Art of this house?
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain.
Wilt thou, Strato?
Bonos dies, Sir Toby.
I am sorry for thee, friend.
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.
Nay, very pale.
Howling attends it.
Upon the right hand I.
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.
I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
Eros, thou yet behold’st me?
Have you no more to say?
O, fear me not.
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
But if that I am I, then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine, Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.
Murder?
They all do hate him As rootedly as I.
Good friend, be gone.
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows.
Let’s have the tongs and the bones.
What should I do with him?
He is married?
My duty, madam, and most humble service.
Which be the malefactors?
Is it come to this?
Abide within.
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Is your name Goneril?
I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable.
Soft and fair, Friar.—Which is Beatrice?
Is ’t gone?
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.  
But yet hie you to Egypt again.
So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors.
The man grows mad.
If you like upon report The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
With what addition?
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.
What, jealous Oberon?—Fairies, skip hence.
I know it well, sir.
If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no?
Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.
Swagger?
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
The third part, then, is drunk.
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?
It’s suppertime, my lord.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself.
No, that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her.
Alack, alack!
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.
Tis hard; almost impossible.
Then I defy you, stars!
How fares my noble lord?
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Know you him?
Sir Walter Herbert, a renownèd soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley, Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew, And many other of great name and worth; And towards London they do bend their power, If by the way they be not fought withal.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
Alack, ’tis he.
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it.
I will not stay tonight for all the town.
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.
His majesty, Tend'ring my person’s safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
Intelligence is given where you are hid.
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire.
Prithee say true!
You may go to the devil’s dam!
For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this.
Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.
Shame come to Romeo!
I shall, my lord.
What wouldst thou have with me?
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up, And quenched the stellèd fires.
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.
On, on, you noblest English, Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof, Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
Nay, I will do so.
Pray heavens he be, For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier.
Sir, you speak nobly.
I pray, weep not.
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
Awake, I say!
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
That I’ll try.
Bid farewell to your sisters.
I have it, And soundly too.
Sooth, but you must.
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
Ride you this afternoon?
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Whither goest thou?
What is my name?
About the ninth hour, lady.
Dost thou squiny at me?
Tut, a toy!
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
In the way of argument, look you, and friendly communication, partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the point.
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul Was my great father-in-law, renownèd Warwick, Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?” And so he vanished.
Do you not hear it ring?
God save the king.
We must out and talk.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt.
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
Tell me, thou unknown power—      He knows thy thought.
Nearest his heart”—those are the very words.
To have no man come over me!
Down with the Montagues!
That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal.
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever.
Oh, ’tish ill done, ’tish ill done, by my hand, ’tish ill done.
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto?
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
It is.
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well.
Hold, worthy lady, hold!
Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.
What country, friends, is this?
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows And be a boy right out.
I am not well.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
But there’s no goodness in thy face—if Antony Be free and healthful, so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings!
What, not one hit?
Nor anyone.
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion.
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation.
Hold, there’s half my coffer.
What a man are you?
Ay, ay.
A deed without a name.
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
May it be done?
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child.
I know thee well—a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.
Who’s there?
I know her by her gait.
The duke’s to blame in this.
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders.
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
It was divided Between her heart and lips.
If you deny me, fie upon your law— There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us.
Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.
Tis a match.
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.
Never was seen so black a day as this.
Come, begin.
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night.

Ay, madam.
Thank you.

The glowworm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color.
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
Good Enobarbus!
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.
The villain shall not ’scape.
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
Yare, yare, good Iras, quick.
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called “whore”?
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
What, must our mouths be cold?
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know’st we parted.
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Call not your stocks for me.
Farewell till then.

Who of my people hold him in delay?
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?

For I have neither wit nor words nor worth, Action nor utterance nor the power of speech, To stir men’s blood.
Must I bite?
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Mean you his majesty?

There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
I’ll set her on.
Then let us both be sudden.
Orsino.
Call the slave again.
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor!
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth.
Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.
Plantagenet.
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s Draw lots who shall begin.
They did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes That looked upon ’t.
What can it not?
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides, Who covers faults at last with shame derides.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.
Go get it ready.
No more.
Ay, boy.
What is he that you ask for, niece?
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!
No.
Wonder not till further warrant.
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way.
Eyes, look your last.
Your lady, sir, your lady.
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
Let me be put to death.
Come, bring me where they are.

There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.
He may command me as my sovereign, But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
The ground indeed is tawny.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.
Ready.
Good my lord.
Go with me to the duchess.
Here’s our chief guest.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Marry, this it is, sir.
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
Go, make money.
Say’st me so, friend?
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
Take away the lady.
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
What is it?
Go, sirrah, seek him.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Shut up your doors.
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.
Why?
You do mistake me, sir.
Very like a whale.
Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.” 
Why, the enemy is loud.
You must note beside, That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
Sheathe your dagger.
Look behind you, my lord.
Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I’ll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool.
Tis not the first time you were overshot.
Caliban!
My lord, what is your will?
Then let your will attend on their accords.
My countrymen—     Peace, silence!
Ah, soldier!
And his kinsman too.
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself.
Now, by yon marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words.
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard.
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless.
It is both he and she: Your son and daughter.
March to the bridge.
Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone.
Nay, how now, where are you?
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
Tis sport to maul a runner.
I do remember now.
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee.
Here’s a spirit.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.
Amen.
What, I will be jovial.
Oh yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Tut, fear not me.
Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come, You might have heard it else proclaimed about.
An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.
A man, young lady!
Help, ho!
What’s the disease he means?
When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again.
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
How fares your grace?
I take my leave at once.
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths    in a glass.
Yes.
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
Methinks you’re better spoken.
Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities.
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or close the wall up with our English dead!
You should ask me what time o' day.
As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
This is my treasurer.
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
All the world desires her.
Menas, I’ll not on shore.
You shall, my lord.
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.
I may not breathe my censure What he might be.
Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault, Assemble all the poor men of your sort, Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
I do not, sir.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.
Call in my gentlewoman.
But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate.
I found them on a tree.
I’ll have my bond.
Welcome, gentlemen!
Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps.
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.
How does thy honor?
We will haste us.
Mine eyes do itch, Doth that bode weeping?
I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.   
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.
Nothing?
Behold and see.
Let us deal justly.
I know thee, Roderigo.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth.
O heavy day!
I, madam?
Never come such division ’tween our souls.
Call him.
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room.
Tis known before.
I will help you to ’t.
Monstrous!
Rosalind is your love’s name?
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm, And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
I thank your lordship.
Why, what else?
What, have you lost your wits?
You must not look so sour.
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
I can no more.
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
And you, fair sister.
Why will My lord do so?
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
Marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge.
Oh, thy vile lady!
Beat him enough.
Sure we thank you.
If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it.
What does he say of Brutus?
No cock of mine.
Why, madam, have I offered love for this, To be so flouted in this royal presence?
As birds do, Mother.
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—Come hither.
Now, Iras, what think’st thou?
Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.
You shall be king.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Will not he?
And for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish.
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
Here comes the fool, i' faith.
Take my sword.
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar.
Look you, Cassio and my husband!
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Prithee, peace.
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine.
Show.
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.
Well met here.
Or I, I promise thee.
Let us not leave him out.
Let me hire him too.—Here’s my coxcomb.
Oh ho, are you there with me?
This way, my lord.
Thus high, by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
Before and apace.
Why, what would you?
No, my fair cousin.
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
What’s the matter?
Sit, Jessica.
Follow my mother.
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; I for an Edward weep; so do not they.
More of this hereafter.
Fiery”?
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!
There.
His fault is much, and the good king his master Will check him for ’t.
Yes, that thou didst.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion.
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin.
Conceit upon her father.
Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.
My husband lost his life to get the crown, And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.
There lies your way.
Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?
But if thy love were ever like to mine— As sure I think did never man love so— How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
A very even way, but no such friend.
Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Madam, I wish it may.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Besides, you grow dishonest.
Ready to go, but never to return.
This is mere madness.
I know what reason I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb, Sepulchring an adultress.
And fixed his eyes upon you?
I have it, Tranio!
He does well to commend it himself.
Courage, man.
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates, Who, smirchèd thus, and mired with infamy, I might have said, “No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins”?
Set your heart at rest.
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
Well.
He hath no daughters, sir.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes, Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome.
I stay too long.
Oh, a good wish upon you.
You are now out of your text.
No, and swears she never will.
Ay, ay.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage— The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?
How cheerest thou, Jessica?
O, then it moved her?
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
Art thou a man?
But I’ll not chide thee.
At your choice, sir.
When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Poor souls, they perished.
Ready.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
And so am I revenged.—That would be scanned.
Come forth, I say!
By my troth, thou hast an open hand.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
Help me, help me!
The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.
Good my lord— You have been a boggler ever.
I grant you.
When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast.
Come, where’s the chain?
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
Shall we give o'er and drown?
Well, I will undertake it.
How doth the lady?
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
Much is breeding  Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent’s poison.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breasts In opposition bloody.
God speak this “amen”!
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
I am glad to see your highness.
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
What shall I do?
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife.
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain.
Foul weather?
But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.
Bruisèd pieces, go.
He, for his father’s sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.
Which is Sebastian?
You have it full, Benedick.
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way.
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention —Brutus, what shall be done?
Well, sir, we will not.
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope: that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
Saw you no more?
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?
A bridegroom, say you?
Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.
Even so.—Cover their faces.
I am not treacherous.
What ceremony else?
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land, A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.
Come your ways.
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
What’s that to thee?
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.
An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
Sure it is hers.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.
For what had he to do to chide at me?
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia.
Do it, England, For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.
But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament.
Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o'er the mazzard.
Is this the Prince?
My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
Nothing, my lord.
One knocks.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
Even so.
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Of the king’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.
Nay, but who is it?
What say you, Bottom?
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.
Why, bride!
Briefness and fortune, work!— Brother, a word.
Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.
How now?
To do what, Signior?
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress.
The hour steals on.
He says so.
You have heard him swear downright he was.
Ratcliffe!
What canst thou swear by now?
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person.
Shall we not?
Let me deal in this.
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife.
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
Claudio!
Hark, hark!
This shall end without the perdition of souls.
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.
And what of him, Tranio?
And one Deformed is one of them.
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.
I cannot think you are my son.
Hence!
It is the quality o' th' climate.
Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
I speak too loud.— Where’s Malvolio?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
He was furnished like a hunter.
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.
You have little cause to say so.
Will you be married, motley?
My father was no traitor.
Nor I, my lord.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
Here she comes, cursed and sad.
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch, Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, Had the forehand and vantage of a king.
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound.
I pray you, rise.
Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.
My lord, the army of great Buckingham— Out on you, owls!
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
If I could make that resemble something in me—Softly!
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends— O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him.
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.
Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy, How well supplied with noble counselors, How modest in exception, and withal How terrible in constant resolution, And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, Covering discretion with a coat of folly, As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate.
How now!
I’ll not be strucken, my lord.
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.
Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish.
No king of England if not king of France.
It is a great price for a small vice.
Ah, Rosencrantz!
I know thou canst not choose.
The man should be put into the lanthorn.
Take a trumpet, herald.
So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you.
I must go with you to Belmont.
But, mistress, know yourself.
Well then, the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer.
That I have, lady.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee.
I pity thy complaining.
Yes, gracious madam.
Look, how she rubs her hands.
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
Yea, noise?
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.
I thank you, sir.
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
What are they that do play it?
No.
Pray, do not mock me.
All schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, If heaven will take the present at our hands.

Lepidus is high-colored.
In good time, sir, what’s that?
But by immortal providence, she’s mine.
But as well?
I said thou hadst a fine wit.
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.
No, believe me.
Bear them from hence.
How hast thou offended?
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
More company!
Sola!
How “wear the garland”?
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.
This is some priory.
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter.
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
Come away.
One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.— Where are my slippers?
Go to the gate.
All for our vantage.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom.
You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?— His Jewish heart.
There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine.
I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days.
But where’s the money?
Stand still.
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
What’s the matter?
I have received a hurt.
For your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.
To die, to sleep— No more—and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished!
Not so.
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.
Your betters, sir.
He calls us back.
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
In the wars.
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.
About your years, my lord.
Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
Fellow, I know thee.
And this way have you well expounded it.
Tis his fashion.
The king his master needs must take it ill, That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrained.
Fool, of thyself speak well.
A thousand, sir, Early though ’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master’s ass For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.
If he will take it, so.

And I serve the fairy queen  To dew her orbs upon the green.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Amen.
But, God be thanked, there is no need of me, And much I need to help you, were there need.
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales!

The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

He speaks to me.—I am your master, Dromio.
They bleed on both sides.—How is it, my lord?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
O proper stuff!
Let me ask you one word in private.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind, That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
What should I say, sweet lady?
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
But, by 'r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, oh, for, oh, the hobby-horse is forgot.”      What means this, my lord?
Faith, stay here this night.
Not now.
What sayst thou?
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Expound unto me, boy.
This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.

Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on, and yet, within a month— Let me not think on ’t.
Ay, my commander.
Away!

Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

Thou bleed’st apace.
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

Now, by the world—      'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.
Why dost thou ask?
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say “Thrice-welcome, drownèd Viola!” My father had a mole upon his brow.
Saw you anything?

Art thou contented, Jew?
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.

Is ’t so, my lords of England?
Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.

Thou need’st not to be gone.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
I must be gone.
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee!” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.

The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol.
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper.
Here I am.
He’s a conspirator.
That’s my sister.
Fie, for shame!
But for the seventh cause.
That’s not the tune.
Have you importuned him by any means?
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.
Had he done so?
A ripe age.
Truly, an obedient lady.
Now, Signior, where’s the Count?
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.
Oh, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar!
But to read his right wits is to read thus.
You shall have ransom.
The sweeter rest was mine.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

Now let it work.
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake.
I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.
Most like.
But they’ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire, Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid 'em.
I thank your Honor.
Anon!
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.
What would you, Desdemona?
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?
There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!

What art thou, fellow?
Sweets to the sweet.
I had a wound here that was like a “T,” But now ’tis made an “H.”                                                        They do retire.

What villain, madam?
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
For any good That I myself have done unto myself?
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night.
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.

How now?
A quarrel, ho, already?
Will you be patient?
If you come slack of former services, You shall do well.
The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.—But, on, Caesar.
Hang him, foul collier!
O my dear lord—   Nay, do not think I flatter.
Therefore, great King, We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
May not one speak?
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me, And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.
How do you, Cassio?—Oh, a chair, a chair!
Oh, villain!
Murder!
Will you help?—An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
I doubt not of his temperance.
Half afeard to come.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

So, with two seeming bodies but one heart, Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one and crownèd with one crest.
Or what are you?
Where’s Antony?
So please your majesty That we may wake the king?
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom.
The cockerel.
All take hands.
Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee, for thy desires Are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
Nay, heaven doth know.
And from thy hated presence part I so.
O Friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.
I will be mild and gentle in my words.
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.
Go, get thee gone, I say.
No, boy.
I know thee well.
Come, bustle, bustle.
How do you, Malvolio?
What says Romeo?
Are you a comedian?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
That’s our offer.
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.

Come hither, you rogue!
Here was a Caesar!
He hath not told us of the captain yet.
I’ll write thee a challenge.
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles.
A devil!
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk— Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby.
But if these— As I am sure they do—bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress?
I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er before Did violate so itself.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.

Here.
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.
